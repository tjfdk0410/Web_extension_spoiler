      "In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were \"just happy to be nominated.\" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word \"go,\" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on \"that 'Rickshaw' movie.\" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, \"it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale.\" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; \"In here's where you need it most,\" he says. \"You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch.\" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking \"that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass\" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, \"It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying.\" \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10 \n",
      "True\n",
      "I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about to tell you why.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with \"Red\" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or cliched, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film, I think he might say: \"Get busy watching, or get busy dying.\" Take his advice.Thoroughly recommended. \n",
      "True\n",
      "**Yes, there are SPOILERS here**This film has had such an emotional impact on me, I find it hard to write comments on it.  I've read a lot of the previous comments; all those that gush and eulogise as well as those who think it's over-rated or cliched. Most have got good points to make, however the thing that I think everyone is struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film is *so* loved.  Loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual experience or for those of a more secular nature like myself, loved as one of the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while watching a film.So I'm not going to review it, I'm just going to struggle in my own way to explain this film.  It took me a few viewings to get why I connect with it so deeply, but here goes.Many people in this world are unhappy.  Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy.  Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all.  They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer.  To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow.Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairytales don't come true.  It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist.  And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him.  Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score.It's about Red.  He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope.  He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going.  Hope is, as Red say, dangerous.  The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it.  A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer.  Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do.  They're too busy living.The miracle in this film is not only that Red is redeemed but that the world outside the prison isn't all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent fishing.  Some of it is rocky and uncertain.  Fairytales don't get this far. They'd end as Red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say 'and he lived happily ever after'.  This is the only film I can currently think of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit from your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging groceries at the local store.  In other words, they're not going to cheat you and tell you everything's going to be alright.This is crucial.  For two and half hours, those of us who are quite content to mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite different to Andy's mapped out on the screen.  And it's a real way out. It's hard and upsetting, but ultimately rewarding.  The high you get from finding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphine.The trouble is, if you're already busy living, this film won't mean that much and you'll see it a little more clearly than those busy dying.  To those fortunate individuals, watch this film and understand what the rest of us are going through.So, yes, this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it isn't realistic and at second on the IMDb all time list, it is a bit over-rated. However if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives saved, altered and improved, the Shawshank Redemption would be way out in front at number one. \n",

      "At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the \"only\" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words \"His judgment cometh and that right soon.\" The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.\" Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the \"sisters,\" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the \"redemption\" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb. Don't miss it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!) \n",

      "In recent years the IMDB top 250 movies has had THE GODFATHER at number 1 while THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has remained at number 2 . The only exception was early in 2002 when FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING topped the chart for a couple of months then dropped down to number 2 for a couple of more months . I`ll probably make myself very unpopular for saying this but I don`t think SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION deserves to be so high !!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!What I don`t like about it is the amount of cliches . New prisoner arrives and finds a maggot in his food , prison cliche 37 . New prisoner gives maggot to old prisoner to feed his pet bird , prison cliche 43 . It`s revealed at the end that the prisoner who has spent so many years inside is innocent after all , prison cliche numero uno . Did anyone believe during any part of this movie that Andy Dufresne was guilty ? Neither did I . Maybe that`s why I love the American prison series OZ because all the inmates there are totally guilty . There`s other things wrong with the movie . It`s about half an hour overlong , and there`s rather unrealistic bits like the warder having someone killed after finding out Dufresne is probably innocent. Oh and how many prison friendships has there been between a black man and a white man ? Maybe that last point shouldn`t be taken as a criticism because the performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are very good and make the movie . Neither of them give a flashy performance ( Again not a criticism ) but both are very subtle in their roles , can you imagine how different this movie would have been if we`d had Tom Cruise and Denzil Washington as the stars ? Perhaps because Freeman`s character of Red does seem to have been written as a white character he`s so good in the role . Am I alone in thinking Freeman has been the best black actor in Hollywood for the last decade because he`s more interested in exploring the character instead of playing someone who`s black ? There`s also some outstanding touches from director Frank Darabont . Witness the scene early in the film where Andy spends his first night in prison with the darkness falling upon the prisoners faces . It`s almost like the artwork of Andy Dogg as the prisoners look out onto the landing as they search for fresh prey , and there is quite a touching sequence as Red leaves prison out into the harsh outside world to the strains of Thomas Newman`s scoreI gave THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION eight out of ten . It is a classic feel good movie but unfortunately being a cynic I do think it`s slightly overrated by IMDB voters \n",

It somehow gives Me sense of peace and inner strength.So, It wasn't all that strange for me to pop it in when I was going through a rough patch in my marriage. I found myself identifying with many of the characters in this movie.Many of them are trapped in a world of regret and mourning, due to a mistake that had been made early on in their lives. This film gave me the strength to escape from my world of misery. And now I am able to say I, Like Andy broke out of my own personal Shawshank.My Ex isn't too happy about the divorce.

      "A friend of mine listed \"The Shawshank Redemption\" as one her all time favorite movies and that brought on my curiosity what Shawshank Redemption was, I even thought it was a typo. The next day I went out and brought home the 10 years anniversary DVD without knowing I was going to spend the most worthwhile 2 and a half hours of my life in front of the TV (a melodrama doesn't kill, right?)I don't know how to write a good movie review so I guess telling you what I feel about it may do better. I remembered crying a few times, being astounded by the plot twist for a moment or two and ending up sitting alone, inert and all, just because of the once-in-a-lifetime beauty of Shawshank. Just recall the scene in which Andy locked himself in the room and turned the music on, all the cons stood paralyzed on the ground, listening to the magical tune like the song of hope they had never heard before.Shawshank is more than a feel good movie, it's about life-changing experiences, about the endless struggle against life's harshness and unfairness, about true friends who will stand by you forever... The simple yet hard to convey messages could not be handled more subtly than this.Shawshank should have won every Oscar for any categories it was nominated, but it's all about struggling against unfairness, time's proved its monumental magnitude.Shawshank is a lesson of life that you have to learn in just 150 minutes. \n",

      "Well I guess I'm a little late to the party as far as writing down a review for this picture. I've seen it a couple of times, but that was before I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first discovered this site a few years ago, \"The Godfather\" was in the Number #1 spot, and since then the films have traded places for first and second, with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That puzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight, and I've come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way, shape or form, and my personal Top Ten list includes titles like \"On The Waterfront\", \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". I may have to reconsider that list, an infrequent exercise but one I don't mind doing every now and then as situations warrant.Overall, the film is darn near perfect. I know it's pretty cliché to state it that way, but when you analyze the dialog, the characters, the directing and the tone of the movie, the picture flows flawlessly, even when it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlen's release and new prisoner Tommy's introduction late in the picture. Every set-up, every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize Andy's quest for escape and personal redemption. Remember Brooks feeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon? How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. The story transcends one man's confinement for a crime he didn't commit, and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control. Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in 1967's \"Cool Hand Luke\", but his method was self destructive. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize, even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so.But even more so, you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), a convict who sees Andy as a person, and over time, an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend. From Andy, he comes to understand that even as a prisoner, a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. Not bad for a convict who started out believing that 'hope can drive a man insane'.I really can't recommend this picture highly enough, both for it's masterful story telling and it's technical execution. The actors, even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles. They deliver a seamless performance that's virtually unmatched by most modern films, in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance. \n",

      "I finally watched The Shawshank Redemption and I agree that it is an excellent film. The pacing, directing, and storyline, holds interest throughout, along with a superb supporting cast, and a very moving ending.The main character is Andy played by Tim Robbins who is imprisoned for the murder of his wife. Later on in the movie, the evidence comes out that he is truly innocent. However The Shawshank Redemption sends a powerful message that it doesn't matter whether you are innocent or not inside Shawshank penitentiary. This is because the prison is run by a sadistic and corrupt staff. In this facility, you must use all of the intellect you can, both book smarts, and street smarts to not only stay alive, but prevent yourself from going insane within the system.Andy befriends \"Red,\" a fellow inmate, played by Morgan Freeman in another great performance. He teaches Andy street smarts of survival within Shawshank's hell-hole. Andy, an experienced banker with a master ability for finance and book learning, manipulates the prison officials to get funds to set up a \"basic skills\" learning facility within the prison's library. Red helps him organize this, and HOW Andy sets up the funding is really an amazing part of the movie. Another inmate is the head librarian, known as \"Brooks,\" who delivers many amazing scenes in the movie.What is special about The Shawshank redemption is how the characters, especially Andy and Red, are able to use their inner abilities to rise above the conditions of the prison and the people who run it. There are some disturbing and violent images that show the harsh realities of prison life, such as fighting, and often getting beaten by the staff or punished for very small offenses and a lot of times for no reason at all. The Shawshank Redemption shows the abuse of power by prison authorities and how the inmates have to have the courage to rise above this abuse, because they need to do this, in order to keep living. They learn that failure to get this courage and survival skills from other inmates will destroy them. A great quote in this film is. \"you can get busy living, or you can get busy dying.\" Another interesting experience is how Red often wonders how at his advancing age he will be able to survive outside the prison if and when the parole board lets him go. An underlining message is that whether you \"get busy living or dying\" you become so accustomed to life in a controlling environment that the outside world, and the struggles, to reach it, to become physically and mentally \"free\" are an enormous challenge requiring great perseverance and the ultimate in determination.As good as this movie is, I was looking for that spark of magic that would put it at and over the top of all time classic films. However, I think that there are some outstanding prison movies that are just as good if not better than The Shawshank Redemption. Watch the Sean Penn Movie, \"Bad Boys\" for an outstanding portrayal inside and outside a juvenile prison. (Interestingly, Clancy Brown, who plays the bad officer in \"Shawshank,\" is just as good as a prison bully in \"Bad Boys.\") Another great movie is \"Midnight Express\" which is (although loosely) based on the real story of Billy Hayes who was arrested in Turkey for trying to smuggle hashish back to the USA in 1970. This is another amazing survival prison picture with an unforgettable musical score and some chilling moments.I see The Shawshank Redemption equal to, but no better than \"Midnight Express\" or \"Bad Boys.\" This is NOT a criticism of a fine movie! I am only putting The Shawshank Redemption in strikingly similar prison survival pictures that don't get the same credit that this movie does. Call this movie the greatest ever, and you have to do the same for \"Midnight Express\" or \"Bad Boys.\" All three films have the same emotional impact. Another under rated movie that you should see is \"An Innocent Man,\" which is also similar to The Shawshank Redemption but is considered only above average.The Shawshank Redemption is a great film for its time. But because of similarities to other similar prison pictures, I can't classify it as great for all time \n",

      "To tell the truth, I am speechless. I am a young movie fanatic, in fact, this film came out the same year I was born, and therefore I am more used to films incredible special effects, edge-of-your-seat action, et cetera. This film has none of that, and yet, it appeals so closely to me. The way Frank Darabont uses the narration of Red to drive on the story, the beauty of the soundtrack used (note the harmonica used just before Red's finding of the letter close to the end). The entire film, from beginning to end, from actions to sound, is a beacon of hope, judgement, and redemption. The cast is perfect, Morgan Freeman(Red) actually brings about a refreshing feel to the tale, and that is exactly what the movie is, what a movie should be. Highly recommended for every viewer, no matter your taste(or age- !judgement excludes use of language or violence!). I can't say it deserved its nO.1 position, i can't say any movie does, but if any movie should, this one might as well be it. ********* \n",

      "From the director of 1990's \"Buried Alive\" comes perhaps the strongest drama of 1994. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is emotionally fulfilling in every way, uplifting its audience again and again. Darabont's screenplay, adapted from (and expanded upon) Stephen King's short novella \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\", is at once soul stirring, heart-rending and disarmingly funny. As director, Frank Darabont brings this poignant and oft times surprising (largely unpredictable thank goodness) script to the screen with the kind of loving care that only a writer/director can, ensuring that all the right elements are brought to the surface.Startling performances from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and the entire support cast help make this picture a powerful production. As convicted double murderer Andy Du Fresne, Robbins portrays innocence and determination superbly. He's a man who not only strongly believes he has a future, but that it's a good one. Freeman is spot on as the world weary \"Red\", the lifer who specialises in the supply of merchandise (\"whatever you want\") to other inmates. He is gradually transformed, and always surprised, by Andy's optimism, geniality and brilliance. In support of these two leads are some very strong turns which provide an over all feast of superlative acting talents.The cinematography is superb, capturing some spectacular images of the foreboding Shawshank prison, while Thomas Newman's music is awe inspiring and must be duly recognised as a truly moving composition.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a long movie, though it would seem that to shorten it would mean to miss out on some powerful, if not crucial scenes. In this light, the editing team have done a marvellous job.What makes this film so effective is Darabont's brilliant script and astute direction, coupled with the strong acting and great support production. Darabont achieves all his objectives, making us laugh, cry, listen and think, he both surprises and inspires us many times. We're left in the end with an uplifting and wholly satisfying movie, which is unexpectedly memorable and magnificently rewarding. A definite triumph of the human spirit.Perhaps the conclusion could be called simplistic, but certainly not expected, and that's what makes this story so great. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" comes from nowhere to really hit you with its well written characters and even its carefully researched history. Wonderfully emotionally telling and thankfully intellectually sharp, its a pleasure that you must treat yourself to! Look for two brilliantly played characters in the form of the menacingly sinister Warden (Bob Gunton) and the despicable, ruthlessly violent Captain of the Guards (Clancy Brown).Thursday, July 27, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema\"The Shawshank Redemption\" was the surprise of 1994 from director Frank Darabont. Full of emotional highs both comic and poignant, it is by far the best prison film I've ever seen. Performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are truly inspired, whilst a classy support cast lend strong backing. Cinematography is at times breathtaking and Thomas Newman's score is sweeping and melodic.For uplifting cinema that constantly comes form nowhere to move its audience you can't go past \"The Shawshank Redemption.\"Tuesday, April 30, 1996 - Astor Theatre \n",

      "In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the \"bull queer\" gang \"the Sisters\" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston). In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library. In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias \"Randall Stephens\". In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package. The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest. After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited. \n",

      "Im not going to sit here and go into a deep explanation of what this film is about, because that has been thoroughly explained in many of the other reviews. What I will say is that The Shawshank Redemption is without any doubt the most amazing film ever written. The acting is tremendous, the story is original, and the movie itself has a deeper meaning to it. This movie is not about the hardships of prison, it is about the importance of friendship and the realization that hope is your greatest aspect. This piece does not focus as much on Andy and his great escape from Shawshank, but more on Red finding that there is always meaning and a purpose for everything. The story really unfolds when Brooks, an old timer that Andy and Red had been close friends with, is put on parole and released from prison. After confronting the outside world and knowing that he could not cope with it, Brooks finds that he has no purpose outside of life in jail and hangs himself. Later in the movie, after Andy makes his great escape from prison, Red is finally released from Shawshank himself, and is put in the same situation as Brooks. Only one reason marks the fact that Red himself didn't commit suicide. That reason is Andy. Red figures out that he does have a purpose outside of prison which is to see his best friend again and to \"give him a handshake\". And as the movie comes to a marvelous ending, that hope to see Andy becomes a reality.Overall the best movie I have ever watched and I am glad to say that I will continue to keep watching it again and again and again. \n",

I didn't want to see it on video either.The video store owner implored me to watch it and I remember my emphatic reply. \"I'm not watching a 3 hour film about a prison con doing tax returns for the guards\". Fortunately for me, this video store owner was a mightily persistent sort and I begrudgingly walked home not knowing that I had just rented the greatest film ever made.This film received no hype nor the mega-bucks publicity given to a lot of movie trash out there. Because they didn't need to - all they needed to do was to let people watch it because word of mouth is the best marketing ticket in town. And so it proved.The movie is long and relies on a storyline which has been covered many times. Wrongful conviction, brutality in jail, justice in the end. But it is the way in which the story is told and acted out that defines it, quite rightly, as IMDb's top ranked film.I don't care for Stephen King as an author but his vivid imagination coupled with his skill at telling a story (a short story in this case) is top drawer. We have a man (Dufresne) who after being convicted wrongfully for murder, uses his accounting skills in jail solely to survive. Red (Freeman), the man who can \"get things\" befriends him. The story then slowly unravels with shocking scenes of brutality intertwined with flickers of how the human spirit can overcome the most hazardous odds. The Warden, Samuel Norton, is magnificent as a man whose corruption has spiralled out of control and will do almost anything to retain the status quo. Clancy Brown as the brutal guard completes the double act.The story twists and turns leaving the audience not quite knowing whether we are in for a harrowing or euphoric ending. And when the ending comes on that Mexican Beach you can almost hear the triumphant cheers ringing around the cinema halls.This is film making at its very best and it is highly unlikely that Robbins and Freeman will ever better it. Its one of those few occasions where 10 stars is not nearly high enough.So if you have been living under a rock or are as sceptical as I was in the early 90's, then it's time for me to adopt my friendly video store owners guise and say \"Watch this - its the best film ever made\". \n",

A film called The Shawshank Redemption.Never has been before the film came out, illustrates the triumph of human spirit behind any hardship in the most moving manner until this inspiring film. It's powerful in every way, that for me it brought back the real definition of an excellent film which is \"a great story with great characters\".Mainly about Andy Duferne (Tim Robbins) a skilled banker who was convicted for murdering his wife and her third party who's a pro golfer. Duferne, sentenced for double life imprisonment was sent to the notorious and sullen looking Shawshank prison to serve his sentence. While counting his days inside, several events happened to Andy. Meeting \"the sisters \" was one of his hardships he needed to go thorough, as they sexually assault selected prisoners like him, which made his stay harder and longer than he thought. One day, he also met Ellis Redding (Morgan Freeman) who was literally known to get things and run it through the walls of the prison, as Andy asked him for a hammer. Unknown to Andy, Redding had his bet on him earlier, as the first one amongst the newest batch of inmates to break down. Subtlety, the two became prison buds as the days became months and the months became years. The two almost stick together the whole time of their stay. They conversed things about the realities of prison. Which at times they contradicted at each other's opinion for Andy had always been the \"hopeful dreamer\" and Redding with his face of realism.The story soon evolves into great circumstances in favor of Andy, in spite of being a workhorse inside the prison, exploited by several police and the warden himself for his skill of handling money, Andy through his skill, will, and hope proved that there were great things waiting to happen for those who hoped and wait. For he always believed that HOPE is a great thing, that everyone should always have.The Shawshank Redemtion is a film for the ages. Its beauty as a whole will never fade as it is one of those greatest films that show an almost tangible message to fathom. It is substance over style at the end of the day. And what it evokes is what matters which leaves you moved and some even satisfied for every tear that they shed from an abundance of happiness gave by a magnificent piece of literature.It's the best film I've seen and it will always be carved to the bank of triumphant feeling.Truly excellent, 10/10. \n",

This is the closest thing film has to a perfect story. The characters, pacing, plot, monologues and every other element contribute to an inspirational yarn with a fulfilling ending. Brook's suicide is the only film scene that has ever moved me to tears, and if you watch just one film in your life - let it be this.

      "Deliberately (some might even say slowly in places) paced, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" alternates between offering a grittily realistic portrayal of life in prison and flights of fancy that make the story too unbelievable to really be accepted. There is an interesting subplot (which doesn't take up much of the movie but which does make the viewer ponder) about the difficulties of adjusting to life in the real world after extended periods of incarceration. The performances from the two leads are excellent. Morgan Freeman puts on his usual outstanding performance as \"Red\" - the wise old con through whose eyes the story is told, and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresnce, a young banker wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover who has to adjust to the nightmare of prison life. Among the supporting cast I was impressed with Bob Gunton as the Bible-spouting but corrupt Warden Norton, who uses Andy's financial expertise to enrich himself, and James Whitmore as Brooks, imprisoned for fifty years and terrified when he is finally granted parole and who, unable to adjust to life on the outside, yearns only to be back in the only home he ever knew - prison. It's an interesting twist - experience also by Red later on in the movie - that freedom can seem to be like a prison for those so accustomed to the regimentation of life in an institution.While the movie is impressive and engrossing all the way through, though, there are some weaknesses to the story that bothered me a bit. (There are some spoilers ahead.)I found it difficult to imagine prison guards from all over the State of Maine bringing their tax returns to Andy. It just didn't seem to me like something that would have happened. It also struck me as unlikely that a letter-writing campaign from one solitary prisoner (even one that lasted six years, one letter a week) would have convinced the State to fund the improvements Andy got for the prison library. I would rather expect that after a while the letters would simply start to be discarded. Andy's escape also bothered me. It was too \"easy\" - even though it took twenty years. And how did he keep that suit so spotless and unwrinkled while crawling through that dirty sewer? Mind you, the moments leading up to the discovery of his escape were among the most dramatic in the movie. The very end of the story was also clearly telegraphed some time before.Frankly speaking, I think \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a bit over-rated here at IMDb, being ranked the second best movie of all time, but this is still a very, very good movie, and an excellent portrayal (through Andy) of the survival of the human spirit in even the toughest times. Personally, I give it a 7/10. \n",

      "It bugs me that this movie is rated so high- not because it's a \"bad\" movie, but because it's a mediocre one. Apparently, mediocre people reward mediocre cinema. This movie tanked big-time when it was initially released, and with good reason. It wasn't until pseudo-intellectuals across the country started hyping it as defacto \"favorite movie\" for Lowbrows world-wide that it started dominating the IMDb \"best movie\" list. In reality, \"Shawshank\" is like a sewage pump for every idiotic Prison Movie cliché ever made. Every guard is a monster. The warden is religious, therefore Evil. Not a single prisoner is actually guilty, or if they are, they're so obviously redeemed that we're supposed to feel sorry for their unfair imprisonment. Murderers and sex offenders sit around in beatific awe as Opera plays over the loudspeakers. Right. The whole movie is so fake, so smarmy, and so condescending that it's no wonder that so many Americans, (with their odd addiction to fake, smarmy, condescending things) consider it their \"favorite movie\". I guess thinking for yourself is a burden to great for some of us to bear. \n",

      "Shawshank Redemption (1994)The short of it: I asked some students what their favorite movie was, and some of them (many of them) said, \"Shawshank Redemption,\" and I said, \"I haven't even seen it.\" And they assigned it to me as homework. I started watching, and after about twenty minutes I realized I had, in fact, seen it before.That's how memorable it was for me.I also see that Shawshank has the highest user rating of any film on IMDb. What do these other intelligent, movieloving people see that I don't? I wish I could know, but I can't except by reading their comments. And here, then, finally, is mine.First of all, I don't think it's a terrible film, despite all the picking I do. I'm trying to be analytical. But when I take one aspect and think about it independently, and compare it to other movies I like, it starts to look weak for specific reasons, which is good to know. Please don't read further if you just want a confirmation of why this is a great film. In brief, I don't think Shawshank probes, invents, or seduces aesthetically. It's just a nice story well told.First, that story. Stephen King is a successful writer, to say the least, and a really good \"wordsmith.\" His stories work with simple conflicts, and they are plot driven--one thing happens, another thing happens, a third thing is almost necessary to have happen, a twist, a turn, and always, from what I can tell, a nice wrap up. That's pretty much the plot in Shawshank. There is almost no depth to the characters--they are stereotypes, not made of foamcore maybe, but flimsy. There is the evil warden, of course. There is the thoughtful black man who everyone likes, played by Morgan Freeman (who narrates), and the thoughtful white man who doesn't like anyone (at first), played by Tim Robbins.Of course, it goes from there, but really, the \"twists\" are old ones. The plot is the framework for something I found more irritating, and that was a slightly glib tone. The story was not really \"realistic\" in any sense, though the trappings of actual prison life are all there, from rape in the back room to corruption in the front office. Maybe as a \"fable\" it can get away with its airiness, right up to the final happy ending. It might not need any grounding in reality. As a fable it would naturally avoid complexity, or even anything independently interesting. What I mean is, maybe the journey through these familiar clichés, done with a fuzzy, congenial ease, is self-satisfying on purpose. And therefore Shawshank Redemption is heartwarming and enjoyable, to use two words that are as exciting together as milk and warm.But it was this breezy tone that made it unwatchable for me. I had to fastforward through a few parts in the second half (it was my second time seeing it). It seemed that nothing happening! Nothing I hadn't seen before in other movies. It struck me not as mythic or spiritual (those are words people use) but as false, as anti-meaningful because it's obvious, familiar, comforting.The film-making? Let's tick off some basics. Editing: conventional, and downright slow. You can argue the pace was leisurely and luxurious to draw the viewer in. Or you can say it's drawn out and sluggish.Music: functional and familiar, \"movie music\" pure and simple, in its lush seduction, which is offputting once you pay attention to it directly.Script: hmmmm. The writing is not distracting or \"bad\" especially, but that's hardly a recommendation. It gets the information across. But really, read some lines, repeat a few scenes out loud. There are those now famous lines, about everyone being innocent and so on, but most of the movie doesn't crackle--even other Hollywood heartwarmers like Die Hard have more inventiveness. Isn't Shawshank presenting Hallmark sentiments?Acting: exactly what the film needed for its pace and intentions. No faulting Freeman or Robbins there.Photography: professional. If there was a movie crying out for some great filming, this is one, with a great interior to exploit and some good night scenes. But the camera work is functional, with a few moments of higher drama (the prisoner getting shot from above, the escape sequence). But look how often the scenes are just filmed \"nicely\" so that we enjoy being there. Maybe this is the idea, to be caressed and not assaulted--it's not an action adventure film, so I don't expect to be shocked. Direction: finally, the lynchpin person here needs to be accountable. Oh, I'm sure Frank Darabont doesn't mind the cult status of his movie, but he probably knows he is no auteur, but rather rode the coattails of a lot of talented craftspeople around him. But those other people all had to count on him to ask for (and deliver) something with more originality, beauty, surprise, depth, and compactness than the Shawshank we have. It's not a shame, obviously, that we have what we have, because so many people love it, really really love it. I didn't care for his other well known film either, The Green Mile, and so again, it's just what you want from your two hours of absorption.But it brings me back to where I started, which is to realize that there are all kinds of viewers, and movies to match. This one didn't go the places I need a great movie to go. It's not a bad movie, not at all. In fact, this might be a classic example of a movie being much more than the sum of its parts. But, still, even the whole strikes me as flip and easy-breezy, obvious as child's lie. It is content to be superficial, and I, personally, am not. \n",

      "'The Shawshank Redemption'... hmm where do I start. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is clearly one of the greatest films ever, I find that it really can show what it would be like trapped in a tiny little prison, eventually you would only think of what's outside the prison instead of inside or you might even become attached to the prison or should I say home.What the audience really enjoy's about this movie is that you have been deceived for you believe through out most of the movie that there is noway out for poor Andy Dufresne and that he is trying to be nice to the guards for a chance of believable. After that you discover that the whole film and everything that has happened has all gone towards the escape of Andy Dufresne and the suicide of the dreadful warden. The audience has been gullible enough to believe that Andy was getting used to the prison. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is clearly not just a movie, it is also beautiful art. Every little piece of the movie was delicately put together to create pure yet daunting art.The story is about Andy Dufresne a wealthy intelligent banker who's wife is having an affair with another man. Eventually both the wife and the other man are killed while having sex, with all evidence pointing to Andy, Andy is sentenced to two life times of prison. In prison Andy does a lot of the workers at the prison's (and that include's the warden) banking. From then of the story is all about Andy in the prison and he idea's of hope and love of music.One of the most beautiful and touching moments in the movie is when Andy locks all the doors in the room that has the microphone and plays opera music of two Italian women singing opera in Italian. Morgen Freeman then say's that he had no idea what the two Italian women were singing but doesn't want to know, he just like to imagine that the words were too beautiful to be sung in English.The acting is brilliant and the directing is directed absolutely unbelievably tremendous. I praise both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins for a very touching movie that I will always remember.In conclusion, 'The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films ever that I have ever seen, if you do not like it I will also understand that you didn't listen closer to the brilliant word that were able to come out of the actors mouth.Hope is a dangerous thing. \n",

      "This is a good movie, and surely is right up there among the finest prison/concentration camp depictions which almost ALWAYS have at least competent quality. In my mind I compare this genre to \"submarine\"-films: confined space, lots of guys under constant threat, therefore drama and tension easily created without much sweat (ha ha). But also with obvious problems in providing something new. The same situations and characters are presented just from here to eternity, and I rest my case with this movie in question as follows: despotic warden, sadistic guard/s, evil fellow inmates who want to kill/rape you but also few trusted friends (along with that one old timer and his inevitable sad ending) and finally escape by the main protagonist who of course has been convicted in the first place based on false accusations or at least something not-so-bad crime.So what's so special here? 9.1/10, come on... Maybe the same tricks worked here as in that other Stephen King's hit-penitentiary-drama \"The Green Mile\", i.e. manipulative scenes and quickly identified cardboard characters. Or maybe the majority of movie-goers consider what they're watching at face value and never mind that \"I've seen this all before\"-feel. Or maybe they haven't or just have a lousy memory? Yes I admit, I'm something of a cynic. But I also believe I'm able to spot an truly honest effort when I see one. Probably that's the reason why I consider the grandpa of them all, Mervyn LeRoy's 1932 \"I'm A Fugitive From A Chain Gang\" as the all-time best prison-flick. No film-snobbery here, as I hope you'll agree when you see this true classic. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that creates a sense of mystery and power. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie by displaying their roles as best friends. After watching that movie for the first time, I remembered clips that are drilled into my mind forever. It is beautifully written and directed. The scene that sticks out to me is at the end of the movie when Andy Dufresne and Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding reunite at the end of the movie. This promotes the aspect of friendship that will live on forever. Even though these two men have lived in prison for years, they eventually got out (well Andy escaped) and they still managed to find one of the most important things in their lives, each other. I recommend this movie to all ages. Although this movie may be a complex the first time you watch it, but after several other times, it still creates a sense of thrill and hope for the viewers. 10 out of 10! \n",

      "And I truly mean that. When I first saw this film, I was blown away.With superb acting, superb story, perfect emotion and tone, and an incredible twist ending that still amazes me, this film is completely and utterly perfect. The film speaks of hope, and the film's two main characters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes that, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used because it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes that hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better tomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight. While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be held to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of the greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is merely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly great, but not the masterpiece that it is today. And, watching it repeatedly makes the film even better, because experiencing the events that occur within the story makes the ending even greater. I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over and over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I simply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that makes this film incredible. However, I will not waste any more of your time talking about how wonderful this film is. And please do not waste any of your own time. Find a way to see this movie as ASAP.

      "***WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*** In 2007, the American Film Institute released the 10th anniversary edition of their 100 Years...100 Movies list. On this, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" was listed at #72. I find it insulting it was ranked so low.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is adapted by Frank Darabont from the novella \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" by Stephen King. There have been many adaptations of King's works (e.g., Stand By Me, Misery, The Green Mile, etc.) but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" outshines them all. Why? Because it is nothing short of outstanding.For those of you who don't know what Shawshank is about, it concerns a banker named Andy Dufresne - played by Tim Robbins - who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his philandering wife and her lover and sentenced to life imprisonment at Shawshank State Penitentiary. He becomes close friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), the film's narrator who has a reputation for being able to \"get things\" from the outside world for the other prisoners. He and Andy become the best of friends as the years go by, during which time Andy's financial knowhow becomes an asset to the prison guards, particularly the corrupt Warden, who uses Andy as an accomplice in his money-laundering operation.Shawshank explores themes of redemption and hope. Throughout his time in prison, Andy refuses to accept the hopelessness of his situation and maintains his integrity and self-worth, which ultimately pays off at the conclusion of the film. Likewise, Red finds redemption and solace through his friendship with Andy, by performing acts of common decency that, in turn, build his own sense of integrity, self-worth and hope.It is these themes that do not make Shawshank a great film but an excellent one. The visual style should be applauded, particularly Frank Darabont's direction and Roger Deakins' cinematography. While the characters communicate and interact freely, they are nonetheless trapped within the confines of the prison, accurately captured by the dark tone of the atmosphere that Deakins and Darabont create so well.The performances in this film are masterful. Tim Robbins' lead performance as Andy Dufresne is skillful and nuanced. Each line is delivered flawlessly, his body language and subtle facial expressions are perfect in capturing the character's calm, laconic yet hopeful demeanour. His performance surely merited an Oscar nomination and deserved more recognition than it had from major award ceremonies.The performance of Morgan Freeman is also one to be noted. His narration is superb, and he never fails to connect with the audience. Particularly in the last quarter of the film, Freeman gives solid proof of why he is one of the finest actors alive.The Shawshank Redemption is arguably the best movie of all time and deserved more recognition than it had. Held in high regards by critics and viewers everywhere, it serves as a testament to Frank Darabont's skill as a director and Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's skills as actors. It is surely to go down as one of the modern classics of filmmaking and is up there with \"The Godfather\", \"Citizen Kane\", \"Casablanca\" and \"Gone with the Wind.\" One of the greatest achievements in cinema in recent times. \n",

I have loved The Shawshank Redemption since I first saw it, but only recently had its powerful effect shown to me. In short order I lost my father to illness, my wife to separation, and my career to anger and dismay. Lost in depression, mired in pain, and alone in a large house I watched it again. Between Brooks suffering, Red's hatred of hope, and Andy's response to his final isolation, I stopped feeling alone. It is simple...get busy living or get busy dying.

It certainly should have tied with the winner, the equally good \"Forrest Gump.\"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with murder. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown.As the corrupt, insane warden invoking religion to justify his actions, Mr. Gunton gives a worthy performance.This is a film of rare power. James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant ultimate doom.Politics is also depicted in a negative way in this gritty film. This is a memorable viewing experience for audiences. \n",

And he tries to convince Red during the entire course of the movie that hope is indeed a good thing, even in a prison like Shawshank. In his endeavor, Andy will come face to face with the warden, who is truly a manifestation of greed itself. Many challenges will test his mettle.This piece of art is not to be missed; it is one of the greatest works of modern drama.

      "The reason I am commenting on this film is that I saw that it is #2 in the IMDB top 250 films of all time. Why? It is a good movie, for sure, but there are so many movies that are far superior. Does it really deserve to be ABOVE \"Citizen Kane\"?The Shawshank Redemption is a great story, with fantastic performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, but it is also a conventional Hollywood movie and just doesn't venture into very deep waters.Stephen King creates great stories that hold the reader's interest throughout and are always exciting, whatever the genre. Yet he doesn't really make any very interesting insights into humanity. His characters are either good or evil; there is no in-between for him. That is not to say that his \"good\" characters cannot commit crimes or make mistakes, but the \"evil\" characters seem to have no motivation beyond just being, well, basically evil! For example, Clancy Brown's prison guard and Bob Gunton's warden are rather one-dimensional characters. Why do they exist? To make the protagonist's life a living hell. For no other reason.****SPOILERS BEGIN**** While Tim Robbin's prison escape makes you go \"woohoo\" and jump up and down in your chair, it's just not a very feasible plot development. I mean, come on, the guy is there for 20 years and NOBODY notices that he has dug a four foot hole through his wall? I don't usually have a problem with surrealism in films, but this is not a surreal film. It is otherwise realistic, so the escape scene just didn't sit right with me. ****SPOILERS END****Every scene is accompanied with trite music, so that we know when to be happy, when to be concerned, when to get teary-eyed. The cinematography is technically fine, but there's nothing new in that department. The villains are completely one dimensional characters with nearly no motivation except for their own sadism, and the film leaves no room for you to draw your own conclusions. Like in most Hollywood films, it is expected that the audience is basically stupid so we have to have it spelled out for us in the end. The movie goes on about ten minutes too long. I gave this movie an eight out of ten, because I love a good story and Tim Robbins is excellent as always, but it is not really the most original film of all time.There are several prison films which I would rate superior to this one. Among them, \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\", \"Papillon\", and \"Cool Hand Luke\". See these first before you give this movie a ten out of ten. \n",

As the film progresses it's almost like you know the characters and you're part of the gang with Andy and Red. you feel andy's tenacity as he battles for whats right. As you begin to relate to Andy's feelings you are reminded why he is there: found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover. So when the 'new boy' clears his name there is a huge relief, almost like a maternal feeling of 'i knew it' As the film builds towards the end you cannot know what is about to happen and when it does.... wow; brilliant ending. brilliant film \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption has you hooked from the very first scene. Although Andy's innocence was obvious from the beginning, you just think how he's going to get out of it.For me, the power and depth in this movie was it's ability to make prison life and friendships look better than that on the outside. Also when they were finally released they were so hesitant to live on the outside and wanted to go back in. I'm not sure why this affected me so much but i think it's just the fact that one mistake forced these people to live in a certain way where they don't want so much freedom and they're used to being workers with no rewards. They just couldn't adapt to the outside world. As if it were a different planet or something.Although the men are supposed to be 'cold hearted killers', they seem so nice and are so easy to sympathise with. I know it sounds lame to feel sorry for a killer or thief but i think that the amazing story and acting, had me hoping that all of the prisoners were innocent... except for some obviously. Not to mention the guards were so mean and rude i just wished they would all get punished and tortured at the end of the movie.If someone can feel that passionate and involved in a movie the first time they've seen it...i think it's a sign that if the person reading this still hasn't...they should. The Shawshank Redemption most definitely deserves its spot on the IMDb top #250. \n",

It's true what they say about this having an impact on people's lives as it did me. From the moment it starts and you start to hear the narration of Morgan Freeman you know there is something special to this film.The films message of hope even in the most dark situations hope can be our salvation and it is so true. The film is put together perfectly what brings the film together for me is Morgan Freemans voice it's so powerful, in his acting on screen in the film as well as his narration.There are two best scenes for me most powerful is Reds 3rd parole hearing it sums up total acceptance of what he's done and he can be open to them about how he truly feels without a care or worry in the world. The second is when Red finds the Box under the Oak Tree and the whole story seems to come together at that point. The way time progresses is an essential aspect in this film and that's another excellent example you see of Andy and the Warden almost becoming partners in crime and they develop this close bond. Prison Drama? No that description doesn't give this film justice it's a pure masterpiece and if you haven't seen it I would advise buy a copy now you won't be disappointed.

Then of course you are mesmerized by the hackneyed subplots and obligatory scenes (i.e.) the attempted rape.

It is utterly unauthentic wherever you bother to question its settings or characters.A better prison movie should at least give the audience an idea of what rape, the loss of freedom, the loss of contact to your family and friends, bad conditions and dullness can really do to a person.I like the movie when it manages to show me how Brooks isn't able to adapt the outside world anymore. I find it mediocre when it tries to tell me the story of true friendship, strength and hope itself lying within a prison.

Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver great performances. Thomas Newman's original score is beautiful. It's an engaging film about perseverance, friendship, will power, and hope.But then again, does it really belong in the same company as Godfather, Godfather II, Schindler's List, and other consensus top-ten films? Is it really one of the ten best films of all time? First off, the villain of the film, Warden Norton, is an incredibly cartoonish, two dimensional bad guy. He and Cal from Titanic could have a \"pure-evil-for-the-sake-of-being-pure-evil\" standoff. Aside from greed, we have no idea what made him who he was. The Warden is pure evil, and is willing to kill the prisoner who can help prove Andy's innocence in cold blood. And yet, even though Andy is the one man who could expose him and all his criminal dealings, he doesn't do the simplest thing and just kill Andy. Why not? Because Andy has to wind up hugging Red on the beach years later.Secondly, think about the scene where Andy locks himself in a room and plays classical music over the loudspeakers to the rest of the prisoners, who stop in the courtyard and stare up in awe and wonder. Are you kidding me? The scene tries to be a powerful, emotional peak in the film, but it comes off as laughably implausible, even in the 1950's.Finally, the movie makes it a little too easy on the audience by giving it all the answers. Is Andy guilty? Does he really escape? Will he and Red ever meet up again? Nothing is left for the audience to wonder about, no ambiguity  everything is spoon-fed to the audience in tasty, happy-ending bites, right up to the final \"hug on the beach\" scene. Wait",

      "!!Spoilers to this movie, as well as to Sixth Sense and Citizen Kane just for spite!!Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that oozes with \"give me an Oscar pleeeeeease\" all over it. You know the type  - like \"Dances with Wolves.\" Oversentimental and overlong. It's surprising that this movie has such a high imdb ranking considering it's such a very black and white (prisoners=good, prison-keepers=evil) movie rehashing what's been hashed and hashed many times.The story concerns an apparently-wrongly-convicted banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is sentenced to life at Shawshank Prison in that creepiest of states, Maine, for murdering his wife and her lover. His main 'friend' at Shawshank is wily old-time-prisoner named Red (Morgan Freeman). Nobody can deny that Morgan Freeman is one of the greatest actors ever, and I'm not going to. Tim Robbins also gives a performance that one wouldn't guess he had in him by watching, say, \"Nothing to Lose\" (which nevertheless is a better movie). And the supporting cast is all excellent in roles that are incredibly one-dimensional. Okay, that's it for the good. Here comes the bad, and the ugly.Early on in the film, Red, who doubles as the narrator, tells us that although he'd like to tell us Andy wasn't gang-raped by some of the fellow inmates (the only bad inmates in there, by the way, and then they get sent away, so that leaves only good ones) but he can't, cause \"that'd be a fairytale.  And there are no fairytales here at Shawshank.\" How wrong he is! The whole movie is a fairytale (albeit without any of the excitement and fast-pace of one).We get characters who are so completely good as to be Saints for our two main prisoners (and most of the other ones) and the Prison guards and warden who all seem to be variations on the evil stepmother from Cinderella and the evil stepmother from Snow White (heck, they're so evil, their intramural baseball team's name is the Marauders. Gee, I wonder if you people get the hidden message?).The story itself is about two-and-a-half hours of sadism (very slow-paced sadism, mind you), an hour of philosophical jabbering that, frankly, is far inferior to a philosophy class at the college if you're into that sort of thing (Hope is Good? Oh my God! What a revelation! Tell me more! Honestly, I've heard songs which have more depth than this movie!) And half an hour of the ending.It's hard to talk about the faults of the movie without giving away the ending, because, the ending itself is one of the main ones. All good movies have an ending that makes you think (or at least are somewhat open to interpretation, and/or sequels). But not this one. Although I counted at least five or six points where the movie could have ended with leaving some room for thought, it follows through to the bitter predictable end. It's as if it's saying \"you know what, you viewers are all idiots, we better not let you think about anything at all.\" Even if that was true, it's quite insulting.  What's more is the ending is incredibly predictable. How could it not be, if it's told to you in the title of the movie? I mean, imagine if the Sixth Sense was called \"The Dead Psychologist\" or Citizen Kane was called \"The Sled\" (sorry, imdb censorship guys, I know this makes your job harder, but I just can't think of a way to explain it otherwise).And I haven't even mentioned the worst part. This movie is incredibly long and boring. It's not a movie that is \"slow\" or \"moves at its own pace\" - those are alright by me. No, this movie, something is always happening, but not a single thing of interest. And like that for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But still.Another thing is this movie's already-mentioned assumed self-importance. It's irritating at the least. It's a long, boring, unoriginal version of what Cinderella would be if somebody traded in all the women characters for swearing, rape and police brutality. I mean, frankly, Charles Perrot beat you to it by four centuries, that's close to an all time record for unoriginality! \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption offers a life lesson; that no matter what, hope must never be lost. Hope is a good thing. In addition, it shows the true benefits of friendship, of those that care for you.Andy Dufresne was sentenced to two life sentences for the murders of his wife and the \"fella she was banging.\" Inside, he meets Red. Red will learn a lesson from Andy, that hope cannot be stripped from you, no matter what is done to you, no matter what happens, no matter how we suffer, hope will always be there to comfort us. Andy's education gets him benefits with the warden, who makes him his \"financial pet\" for his money laundering activities. He does not know however, that his world is going to come crashing down on him.This movie has had a very poignant and influential impact on myself.

This movie, based on a Stephen King novella, is on my all-time top ten. Of course it has morals and many lessons we can learn, but bottom line, it is a great movie. Even though we know that Tim Robbins is innocent, he acknowledges his guilt on a more subtle level, his failure to be a good person. That he is in prison affords him the opportunity to become a \"good\" man for the first time in his life. He touches the soul of many inmates, in that he educates them in some of the finer things in life, namely, good music and great literature. (He corrects an inmate's pronunciation of Alexandre Dumas' last name from \"Dumbass\" to the correct \"Dumah\") The last quarter of the movie is spot-on great. We are always touched by redemption themes, just look at how popular \"Scrooge\" and \"It's a Wonderful Life\" have become over the years. Shawshank simply is too good to miss. \n",

Its 1 of the most predictable boring movies i have ever seen. The bit were all the prisoners stop and listen to the opera music is just laughable. This just would not happen with hardened prisoners.

      "Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and is sent to Shawshank prison: For Life. Andy is a very intelligent man, a hot shot banker when he was free, and now he's just a number, at the mercy of Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and his head guard, Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown).Andy is a quiet man, but manages to attract the attention of the sisters (Barely Human Homosexual rapists) led by Bogs (Mark Rolston) and he begins his prison life, desperately fighting his admirers, sometimes he'd win, sometimes he'd lose, but he always stayed quiet.Red (Morgan Freeman) is the man who can get things, and he is Andy's first friend on the inside. We witness Andy's relationships with Red, the Guards, the Warden, the sisters and the rest of the inmates, develop through Morgan Freeman's perspective, but always revolving around Andy. In his time there he successfully wins personal battles, gains favour with the guards and inmates alike, and restructures the rehabilitation of so many with his unwavering persistence and drive.All the members of the cast are more than adequate, but i have to single out Freeman and Robbins. Freeman guides the viewing audience in an informative and subtle manner, and Robbins, in his finest performance ever, gives us hope and wisdom, as he manipulates the powers around him so cleverly, to make life as easy as he can for all his fellow inmates.The Movie is very powerful and moving throughout, and it doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of prison life. And at the end when the climax falls into place, you will be left completely satisfied by its unquestionable brilliance.For those who have not seen this movie, all i can say is watch it.10/10 \n",

To start with the positive: the acting (especially by the two protagonists) is indeed of the highest level, and some scenes really grip you. The camera-work is also excellent (beautiful prison-building!)The story of this movie is a 13-in-a-dozen story about someone who (of course) is wrongly sentenced to a long story; who meets his new friend (mostly an elderly person), who makes enemies and defeats them, who turns his long-stay into something good, then is betrayed by his corrupt warden, etc. etc. Sometimes it even got a bit cheesy, the way in which all the prison cliché's were displayed.I could recommend this movie to you, if you are looking for a nice drama with good acting and good camera.

      "Over-long, boring, tedious, over-acted and very very very very very OVER-RATED. Hell knows what goes through the minds of people to vote this the 2nd best film EVER!! I first saw the cut down version lasting 1 hour 25 minutes, and it was still too long.I wouldn't mind but it's so drawn-out, fanciful and pathetic. The things that happen in that prison would never happen, just because some nerdy bank manager has \"hope...\" Give me a break! Which soap opera did that sad line come from! No wonder it was initially ignored, and it should be continued to be ignored. Robbins, who is accused and wrongly convicted for the murders of his wife and her lover, never ages. At one point he HAS TO \"remind\" us he's been in jail for 12 years, because it only looks like a week.Yet did you see the way he really changed in 12 years from 1994 to 2006. He looks a much older man. And of course he does, he's 12 years older!! In the Shamshank Dedeption he never aged one day in 12 years, and his hair is even cut the same style.Even when we then go forward something like 20 years, he still looks the same, never aged at all, apart from a few bluey grey hairs at the sides. And after he escapes (after 20 years of tunnelling through thick concrete with a a small screwdriver), he meets up with his old buddy Freeman, who got out of jail legally. And get this, BOTH look younger than when they first went in.By my reckoning Tim Robbins should now be about 70, and Morgan Freeman in his early 80s, yet both after serving their time still look barely 40.And what a load of talkative rubbish. The most boring over-hyped-up film in history. Complete twaddle. God knows how on earth I watched all of it, but I did if for a bet, 'cause I cannot stand it. Wasn't worth a UK tenner anyway!! My vote, 2 out of 10 for a mediocre drama.Get a life, if this is the \"best\" film you've even seen. Better still, get a cinema ticket!!!! Or rent a DVD. And more than one!! \n",

      "The movie is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen, but to be honest, the movie is also greatly overrated in many ways. I believe that the reason the movie is so popular is because of the huge wave of popularity towards voting it up. As the movie portrays the continuous struggle for the main character, Andy Dufresne, you are in suspense, and locked by the question whether he did it or not. And even though he keeps doing good and honorable thing for the guards and his fellow inmates. There was in my experience not a moment before he escaped where you are absolutely certain that he did not do it. This is the thing that captivates a lot of people i think, and i follow this aspect, and i understand it. But even though this movie, in my opinion does not have any flaws, it is still not perfect, and i do not think that it is the best, not flawed feature film ever made. \n",

It was the highest ranked movie on IMDb, and of course I would give it a go. The beginning was very interesting, with Andy being convicted of double homicide and seeing the lean-back of what happened. Him being found guilty, serving two life sentences in the toughest prison in America, Shawshank. I thought it would be another overrated boring movie like The Godfather, but no, it caught my attention from the start and never lost it either. The dramatic scenes, it gives you a glance of how it is in prison, the emotional scenes. It is all a masterpiece, there is a reason to why it is the best movie I have ever watched and probably will ever watch. The amazing acting, plot and moderate length. The last scene, with \"Red\" walking up the beach towards Andy and the credits slowly rolling in, it makes you beg for it to never end. When it comes to movies I can sometimes get a little emotional if its a good movie, which Shawshank is. It definitely deserves the spot as #1, I cannot understand how it didn't win an Oscar.I really recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good weekend, but get a load of potato chips and soda, since you will finish it all up very fast. \n",

This movie, however, managed to surpass all my expectations.I didn't know much concerning the story, except that it was a movie set in a prison but it's so much more than that. The major theme that became apparent to me throughout this movie was how we regard as good and evil is largely dependent on the storyteller and how he chooses to paint the heroes/villains. Convicted felons are not usually considered 'heroes' or people that you root for and want to succeed but the story is about so much more than that. The Shawshank Redemption is about hope and more importantly the struggle to maintain it, when the world is doing its best to crush it.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's on-screen chemistry is amazing. There are no weak scenes, no wasted dialogue. They are the best things about the movie, they make you believe, they make you hope. \n",

No holes to spot, almost everything was completely accurate, Probably some of the best script I've ever heard and a brilliant story. Normally, If a film goes over two hours, I start to get a little bored and I end up wanting the film to end but this was completely the opposite! I never wanted this to end and the hefty 140 minutes get you wanting more and the story drew me in so much, I felt as if I was there. Normally with films adapted from Stephen King books, they don't do so well on the big screen but this has proved that wrong!

      "This film is about hope, friendship and redemption. It has solid performances from Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton (the warden). Freeman masterfully narrates and he is the life blood of this film. You experience everything through him; friendship, despair, hope, redemption and happiness. The musical score is nothing short of fantastic and really elevates some of the more moving scenes in the film.Firstly, this film is about hope. Andy is wrongly accused of murder and is sent to Shawshank prison. He has no friends and is quickly picked on at arrival because of his quiet, unassuming nature. But as time passes, the other inmates begin to respect Andy because he doesn't allow prison to break him. Andy perseverance is so strong that it begins to rub off on the others. I think to really get this film, you need to step away from the context of it just being a prison movie. You could say the prison is life. The warden and the guards are problems, trials and troubles in life that can test and possible break you.No matter how bad things yet, no matter what brutal things you have to endure, you've gotta hold out hope, you gotta hang on, you have to believe you're gonna get through it. This is about the very nature of the human spirit, told in a very simple, straight forward way.This film is also about the power of friendship. I think Hollywood seems to have a hard time portraying a meaningful, male friendship and just resorts to endless buddy and stoner movies. Shawshank does a great job of this. I felt this aspect of the film was told in 2 parallel stories. The first was the old librarian, Brooks. When he was released, he struggled to adapt to the new world. As Red says, he had become institutionalized so much so that without Shawshank he felt alone, afraid and had no purpose. In the end, it was just too much for him to bear. Easily one of the more heartbreaking scenes in the film, gets me every time. When Red is released, he faces the exact same challenges that Brooks did. And he too struggled and almost lost hope. The only thing that kept him him going, was his friendship with Andy. As Freeman narrates:\"There's a harsh truth to face. No way I'm gonna make it on the outside. All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole, so maybe they'd send me back. Terrible thing, to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things make sense. Where I won't have to be afraid all the time. Only one thing stops me. A promise I made to Andy.\"It was literally the only thing he felt worth living for and a key part of the film I think people forget. And before Andy left prison, you could see how it deeply affected Red. He had lost his friend and the heartbreak of it was written all over Freeman's face, fantastic acting if you ask me; it was subtle, quiet suffering.And finally the film is about Redemption. Some people feel the redemption is Andy's. But I believe that Andy was just the agent of Red's redemption. At the start of the film Red was pretty much redesigned to life in prison. He had accepted that these were just the cards he was dealt and there was no real reason to feel otherwise; he had given up hope. The first few times he went for his parole hearing, Red was just going through the motions, he was just saying what he thought he had to get to be let out. It was completely insincere.You can see an the film progresses Andy changing Red. There's a great scene where Red mentions that he used to play the harmonica. Andy gets him one as a present and later, in a small but important scene, Red picks up the Harmonica and he quietly plays a note. For me this is where Red begins to believe again. But the key scene for me is the last parole hearing. Red has been so affected by Andy, that for the first time he has a genuine moment of repentance, where he honestly admits to his crime:\"There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret. Not because I'm in here, or because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then: a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try and talk some sense to him, tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone and this old man is all that's left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a bullshit word. So you go on and stamp your form, sonny, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a bleep.\"It really is just an incredible, moving scene, one of my all time favorites. Red is completely broken and regretful, it's nothing short of movie magic. And the ending? Well, let's just say it leaves me with a smile on my face. In my opinion this is the greatest film ever made. An incredibly powerful, uplifting story. If you haven't seen this, you need to.http://andretms.blogspot.ca/ \n",

Shawshank redemption is not just about a story where a man escapes from a jail. It captures the life of people who spend their life in jail. I believe that jail life and free life are almost similar. Sometimes we enjoy and sometimes we feel sad whether you live in jail or not. Sometimes life doesn't make any sense at all. Some people succeed in their lives with ease and some people faces a great deal of hardship and still won't succeed in their life. These people are forced to the point of desperation. What they should know is that all of us have a destiny to reach and the main thing which matters the most is \"hope\" which you should need until the moment you die. If you believe in yourself and have hope then one day you will reach your destiny in this life or in your after life.This film has really changed my way of looking the life. \n",

With The Shawshank redemption, IMDb's favorite film, in works in both cases. The acting is superb, and the film is incredibly well written and very justified.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrense, a banker who has been accused of murdering his wife and her lover. So he is sent to Shawshank prison, where he experience's lots of things. He forms a bond with Red(played terrificly by Morgan Freeman). The warden(played by Bob Gunton) hates him. He is raped. And all of this is leading to his escape after being in there for over twenty years.The Shawshank redemption, which is based on a shot story by Stephen King, is one of the most interesting films ever made. It'a also one of the best films ever made too. What is one way to tell: When you hear Morgan Freeman's narration, you know you're in good hands.The acting is explosive. Everyone does such a good job. The Shawshank redemption is a little long, but the length is tolerable. Mainly because from the opening scene the film has you hooked. Morgan Freeman gives the better performance of the two, but the duo of Robbins and Freeman is once in a lifetime.The Shawshank redemption was an Oscar upset. It was nominated for seven, including Best picture, Best actor(Morgan Freeman) and best writing.

      "Stephen King's novella is a damn good yarn. The narrative is always engrossing, the source elements of Andy's secret are carefully placed without exciting attention, and you are delighted when events pan out as they do.Then Darabont adapts it, and a damn good yarn becomes something special. Part of this is the adaptation - a sensitive simplification, part of it is the casting, which is pitch perfect (Morgan Freeman's Red was always an Irish redhead when I read the story - now I can't read it without seeing Morgan Freeman). And most of it, I think, is the direction.The story unfolds in unhurried fashion, with us being unsure of Andy's guilt for much of the movie, but with a gradually building sense of injustice at the way those in power in the system can treat him (and others) unfairly. The secret doesn't come at the end, but at about the three quarters mark, and brings with it a huge emotional kick. And then the story is allowed to make its own way into a gentle and perfect end.This is, without any doubt, one of the most spiritually uplifting films I have ever seen. \n",

      "This movie is poetry. For those of you who've ever felt the way poetry rolls off of the tongue, you'll understand what I mean when I say this.The first thing that makes this movie great is Morgan Freeman's ability to narrate the way he does. His soft, yet ruff voice provides the audience with the belief that this man has endured many years of hardships and has gained wisdom and experience through trial and error. He is a natural story teller, so his ability as a narrator is natural and smooth; not forced, like so many other actors.Tim Robbins displays his acting ability beautifully and captures the audience with an intense amount of emotion, which seems to resonate in his eyes. The genius and wisdom of the character he portrays is a fascinating thing to watch unfold, as the story lays itself out, like a poster of Rita Hayworth.To say that this movie gives the audience hope would be unfair because this movie makes the audience want to live, love, experience life for all of its pleasures and its faults. It makes one appreciate the simple things and slow down a bit, to admire that which we pass a hundred times a day, but never truly see.To describe this movie as \"great\" would be an understatement because it is so much more than that. While it is brutal and realistic, it portrays humanity at our best and our worst, providing the audience with a mirror in which to reflect what lies within. By the time the credits roll, we're left speechless...and at the same time, wanting to share this masterpiece with those we love and cherish.Everyone should see this movie at least once in a lifetime to make us appreciate everything we have. Who would have thought someone could capture humanity this way? I guess a picture really is worth a thousand words...... \n",

The Green Mile gives you a warm feeling at the ending, but not like this does. I just love the way it follows the subplot of Brooks right up until he kills himself. How touching that was to see an old man, let out of prison but without routine. He belonged in prison, not in the outside world.You forget at times that you are watching a movie.

Thank you Frank Darabont for giving us hope. \n",

      "I'll admit, I'd held off on seeing the Shawshank Redemption. I remained a little apprehensive; was this film as great as the masses of IMDb and particularly world wide were saying? From the moment I began watching this film to the very end, I was kept completely in awe at how beautiful and amazing this film is.The Shawshank Redemption is a film set in a US Prison, following the story of Andy Dufrense who was sent to Shawshank for a crime in which he did not forget. Here, he meets Ellis \"Red\" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman) an aged convict who, unlike the majority of the populace, accepts that he is a guilty man. The two develop a friendship over the lasting years, which evolves into what could be akin to brotherhood.The message of hope in this film is as inspirational as it is an interesting concept. Despite being convicted, Andy undertakes a quest to become a free man once more, even if it means breaking the laws and, as shown later in the film, breaking out of ShawshankThe acting in this film is simply outstanding. Morgan Freeman, providing both a character and the narration of said character, portrays his character in such a convincing way that one can't help but feel moved by his dialogue. Bob Gunton, who plays Warden Norton (an immensely corrupt individual), passes himself off in such a brilliant performance that I couldn't help but feel pure anger for the Warden throughout the movie.But perhaps what makes this movie so beautiful is the underlying messages. Despite being incarcerated for life without parole, Andy maintains hope, despite what the others say when he freely speaks of it. The evolving friendship of Red and himself delivers the message that not all criminals are rabid beasts, and that friendship can outlast the grim depression of a prison. Though I am by no means proud to admit it, I felt myself become watery-eyed several times throughout the film, particularly the letter sent by Brooks before he commits suicide, climaxing in a tragic, heart-breaking scene.Wherever you are in the world, you must see this movie. It will most certainly change your life. It did mine. \n",

      "Much has been written and praised (deservedly so) about \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" The fact that it's #1 on this list gives me faith in humanity. Instead of talking about its obvious care with excellent writing, directing, editing and cinematography, I'll just say how much the film has meant to me personally. Its message of hope and, above all, perseverance, kept me going through many of life's travails. I think I responded to how it dealt with the day-to-day grind of life (albeit in dramatic fashion)and even the stress of boredom. The other thing it demonstrated was how profoundly one person can affect another without even saying much to them. After all, Andy and Red only have one true baring-their-souls conversation in 19 years together (One of the greatest scenes in the history of movies, by the way). Yet we are fully aware of how much these two meant to each other and how moved we are when they are reunited. It's a real spiritual journey (visually as well); almost like Red has died at the end (leaving Hell/Shawshank) and is reborn in Zihuatanejo (Heaven)to be rejoined with the one person who understands him. Just a marvelous, life-changing experience for me. My thanks to all who've supported and created this movie. It will live on and be remembered throughout the years as one of the pinnacles of human achievement. \n",

      "Why Shawshank Redemption isn't rated 9.9/10 is beyond me.What has caused me to reflect and comment on this film is the small things...99.9% of movies miss them. A movie is a photographic montage of images with sound and is meant to represent a story. Humans have always enjoyed stories from time immemorial huddled around fires in caves to modern things like FaceBook or YouTube, it's all about stories.Shawshank has many small instances that Frank Darabont included like when Red leaves a small note to Andy with a free poster when he returns from the hospital/isolation. Another small instance is when Andy gives Red the harmonica, it could easily not have been filmed but it touches everyone with its deeper meanings. It's a collage of many small instances that make it meaningful and memorable, over and over again.I am convinced that's why everyone loves this movie and watch it repeatedly, it's the small things that touch you. How many movies have given you the most important small message of all...of hope...it's the most powerful of goals we can have, hope really sets you free. \n",

      "When you look at IMDb's top 250 you see many famous and ambitious films like Star Wars, The Godfather, The Lord of the Rings and others. Not saying that these movies are bad (they are actually quite brilliant) they were made famous because of the publicity and the abilities these films had in the time. Star Wars started the sci-fi age, The Godfather made people interested in the secret society of the Mafia and Lord of the Rings brought life into the fantasy genre again. But what really made these sublime films so popular was the publicity and the fantastic special effects which costed certain amounts of money. In 1994 Frank Darabont decided to have a go on one of Stephen King's novels, not knowing what would happen. They made a film that is honest and that contains (on the contrary to Star Wars etc.) a vital lesson, a meaning and a message to all who watch it.This movie is redefining cinema. No explosions. No heart-stopping excitement. No, it's pure poetry, music and sublime acting. The overwhelming and intriguing story introduces banker Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) who was falsely convicted for a double life sentence in the heavily guarded establishment of Shawshank Prison. His life must go on and he makes friends with other inmates like Red (wonderfully acted out by Morgan Freeman) and Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore brings tears to your eyes). Warden Norton (played immensely evil by Bob Gunton) and Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) don't make Andy's life comfortable in the prison, but with Andy's unique skills he manages to win their attention and gratitude.This film has some terrific moments like the helicopter shot over the Shawshank Prison and the stunningly beautiful scene where Andy locks himself up in the Warden's office and plays Mozart to all the inmates. Morgan Freeman's raw voice makes this moment more powerful than any other moment in any other movie I ever saw. At the release of the film, people criticised the film harshly and wasn't a big hit, certainly not at the box-office. But when the film appeared in the stores it became an enormous hit. And until this day, for over 4-5 years now I believe, it stands on the second place in the top 250, one place away from The Godfather.This is a film you have to see once in your life! \n",

      "I myself, like most people, love this movie and whenever it got to the end where you see Andy and Red smiling and embracing on the beach it always sent chills through my soul, but I realized that in addition to that sequence, where not a word is spoken between the two men, it's that 'deep blue ocean' that makes the ending so dramatic. I think with the exception of a few outdoor scenes in the movie where you see a little sky, the bulk of the movie is shot in the drab gray tones of prison (cause prison is drab and gray), so when that BIG BLUE OCEAN hit's your eyes, it makes the whole experience of their freedom and the fact that they never gave up hope that much more dramatic.Hope is definitely a good thing and quite possibly, the best of ALL things. \n",

      "Andy (superb Tim Robbins) is condemned to stay all his life in prison due to two murders he has not done. There, he will meet Red (Morgan Freeman, impressive, these is one of the best relation love/friendship of all the movies I've ever seen). Red understand perfectly Andy and guides him at the first moments, as we see Andy from Red's eyes, his loyalty and admiration. We understand all these only by his looks and his moves, in one of the best parts of Freeman. Robbins play the part of a distant character, brave, righteous, intelligent, but as everyone, weak, frightened. It's like an angel in the depht of hell. The hardness of the prison and the corruption of the prison system is perfectly told to us by Darabont perfectly. Its realism is sometimes disgusting and the hardest scenes touches you at the depht of your heart. The film has a very high dramatic part, but in any moment becomes too sweety. Its wonderful dialogues, its magnificent study of characters and their psychologies, the charisma of Robbin's character, well absolutely everything helps that this film becomes part of the selected group of every time masterpieces. There are two scenes that I've loved a lot. The one where, Andy is able to listen, relaxed to a Mozart's Opera in the director prison's office (although being in prison, at that moment, Andy is free). And the other where, one of the prisoners, being very old and having spend almost all his life in prison, commits suicide as he cannot get used to a life in freedom. However, despite all the hardness and the few holes to hope that there's in the movie, at the end there's always a little ray of light. The Shawshank Redemption is that, a chant for life, for our dreams... a masterpiece. \n",

Be warned that the first half of the film is visually and psychologically confronting.The film deals with fundamental themes of friendship and hope whilst delivering some very powerful social commentary. I am left questioning the state of our justice system. We lock away these \"threats to society\", alienate them and subject them to the most hostile and unnatural of environments. Then when they have served their life terms, we throw them back into society with the expectation for them to live normally and abide by values never once upheld or taught in their filthy prison cells. The Shawshank Redemption tells a very powerful story. A story that made me laugh and cry. It ignited just about every human emotion I could possibly experience in just over a two hour period of time.A truly amazing film, 10 out of 10 from me! \n",

      "I rarely post comments on movies unless I, {A) Really love it, (B) Really hate it. This falls in the 'really love' category. The first time I watched this picture, I thought it was great, but much to dark and emotional, and contained unnecessary violence/sexuality. After viewing it 2 or 3 times, I finally understand why this movie is so highly ranked by IMDb regulars, and I also have come to understand why the scenes of violence and brutality toward Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) were included in this film. I also understand why James Whitmore's character Brooks Hatlen behaved the way he did. It was all the nastiness that happened to people we really like that makes the victory complete at the end. 5 years ago I would have called The Shawshank Redemption an overrated, self-indulging unnecessarily dark picture deserving a rating of 5 or perhaps 6 at best. Now that the move is nearly 12 years old, and now that I've watched it enough to finally \"get it\", I must agree with the masses and score this with a 9+.

Despite not having a great success while it was at the theaters, now with the VHS and the DVD, a lot of people is having a chance to enjoy 142 minutes of greatness and get away from their boring lives at least for just a while. I find the twist that the story makes when Andy escapes from shawshank as simply perfect and unexpected. The only thing i consider that is wrong on the film is that when the movie is over you want to see more and you can't see more because the movie ended and ended perfectly, but i think that with a masterpiece like the shawshank redemption not even 10 hours of movie would be enough.

In its 2hrs and 22 minutes of run time, this film just does disappoint. It is full of present themes like integrity, friendship, good vs evil, and the most important theme of hope. Hope. Hope which drives a man seeking redemption in the worst circumstances. Hope of reuniting with a friend after decades of injustice (minor spoiler). And Hope that with powerful friendship and spirit, one can overcome any obstacles. In terms of technical merit this film is also very well shot, with 360 degree camera movement giving the audience a feeling of what it feels like to be in prison. In its acting, Tim Robbins convincingly plays Andy Dufresne, a man who has suffered from injustice. Morgan Freeman sells his performance of a Ellis Redding, who follows in on Andy's belief of hope. Needless to say, Morgan Freeman's narration is perhaps the best narration in recent years. Most of the characters in the film are given great emotional arcs with wonderful dialogue. The music in the film is also played really well. Undoubtedly, this movie deserves a 10/10. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption begins with young Andy Dufresne, a young vice-president of a Portland, Maine bank, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and who is sent to Shawshank Prison to live out the rest of his life. There, he learns how adapt to life in prison and learns lessons about life through fellow prison inmates who become his friends. Nineteen years later, Andy finally leaves the confines of Shawshank, on his very own terms.Andy is intelligent and although rather naÃ¯V in the beginning, he is able to adapt to life within prison by learning from Red who takes a liking to Andy's quiet nature. He is resourceful, as shown when it is revealed at the end of the film that he has planned his escape and life after that flawlessly with only resources made available to him in prison. Andy keeps his hope of freedom alive throughout the years with strength and determination. With integrity, Andy is able to make sure that he does not succumb to anything which may become his downfall.Red, who's real name is Ellis Boyd Reading, is the man who \"I'm the guy whocan get it for you,\" he narrates. The long years in Shawshank has Red 'institutionalised', and he can no longer imagine life on the outside, nor does he expect it. Red is better at perception, as he can see in Andy what others cannot, and befriends the younger man.Warden Samuel Norton is both God-fearing and greedy. He quotes many passages from the Bible throughout the story, but has no qualms in ordering murder to protect his ill-gotten money. He is selfish and destroys any chance for Andy's re-trial by getting rid of Tommy. The fact that he shoots himself after the police come to arrest him shows that Samuel Norton is a weak man who cannot bear the burden of his crimes make-shift desk and provides financial advice services for guards and the warden. Andy is also determined, and the others are aware of his nature.Andy's Blind Self incorporates his quiet nature which tend to be misinterpreted as arrogance by is fellow prison inmates. The judge at his trial for the murder of his wife and her lover in the beginning of the film asserts that Andy seems to be \"a particularly icy and remorseless man\". It would seem like Andy's mannerisms have worked against him in that situation. If he had been aware of the way others perceived him, he may have been able to prevent himself from sending out the wrong message.Andy's strength and determination play important roles in his Hidden Self. When Andy first steps foot into Shawshank, Red makes a bet that Andy would be the first one to cry. \"Lookedlike a stiff breeze could blow him over. That was my first impression of the man,\" Red says. But Andy proves Red wrong. He is stronger than anyone thinks. Red gets Andy the rock hammer which Andy says is for his rock collection hobby, and when the tool arrives, Red dismisses the thought that Andy would use it to escape prison. A series of posters covers the tunnel Andy is working on in the wall, and his daily walks outside is used to dispose of the rubble from his digging. Although his determination later morphs into a trait of Andy's Known Self, his resourcefulness is hidden by the facade of a straight and sometimes dull man.The Emotional Self comes into play when Andy seeks redemption. Despite the fact that Andy is innocent of the crime he is accused of committing, Andy feels that he has caused her death indirectly by not giving her enough love and attention. He says; \"I didn't pull the trigger. But I drove her away. That's why she died. Because of me, the way I am.\" He feels guilty for something beyond his control, and neither he nor others know why The Shawshank Redemption takes depth in the basis of human communication; perception. Before the ending of the film, the viewer takes on almost a similar perception towards Andy as Red as the story is from Red's point of view. However, at the end of the film, the viewer learns that what we perceive about somebody or something, may turn out to be something else at the end of the day. \n",

      "In a world plagued with mediocre movies designed to sell a franchise and merchandising, rather than simply tell a captivating story, The Shawshank Redemption stands head and shoulders above any other. The manner in which it's apparent beautiful simplicity is built upon by adding layer upon layer of complex sub-stories and plot twists is absolutely unrivalled. The story centres around a central character, banker Andy Dufresne, an innocent man struggling with the injustice of being sentenced to life in prison for murdering his wife and her lover, but expands with sub stories of greed, retribution, friendship and hope in a way that would please any viewer if these plots were simply allowed to unfold alongside each other. What this film does so well though, and what elevates it from just 'good', is the way it intertwines these stories with a roller-coaster of twists and turns that give every character an utterly believable depth and requires even the most cynical viewer to dispense with the notion of 'suspension of disbelief'. Nothing is unrealistic, nothing is over the top, nothing is under explained and so nothing is unbelievable. The film is also littered with Easter egg like ironies that reward those who allow themselves to be utterly immersed within the story, such as the warden's choice of wall coverings and his words when returning an inmates bible. The film also forces viewers to empathise, not only with the protagonist, but also many of the supporting characters in a way few would imagine they could... considering the majority of them are criminals... including, it would seem, many of those who we expect not to be. In summary, on one level, if you just want a film that tells an interesting story with a happy ending, this is one you should enjoy... if you demand more from a film then this is to be considered mandatory viewing. In short, having seen this film, from plot...to acting... to cinematography, you will be left with a benchmark to measure all others by... and a sense of joy, that you will one day be presented with something even better, and a deep sense of disappointment that you know you likely never will be. \n",

But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen.

Based on a short story by Stephen King (which is truly extraordinary), the plot follows a man wrongly convicted for murdering his wife. The rest of the movie follows his time spent in Shawshank Prison. Written for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont, this movie turned out to be a box office flop; ironically, it went on to become one of the most rented movies of 1995 (similar to It's A Wonderful Life).

The main reason I watched it was because I am a Stephen King fan, and I heard this one was the best. So I sat down to watch it, and I was fully prepared to feel depressed, and also sad. And when I finished watching the movie, how did I feel...there is no way to say it other than: The exact opposite. I felt uplifted, happy, and after watching the ending, I simply said that this was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. What I liked about it so much is mainly the plot, and the characters. Andy Dusfrene, and Ellis 'Red' Redding are prisoners in the Eastern Maine Penitentiary, known as Shawshank. Andy spends over twenty years in the prison, Red even longer. And when I was watching I could feel (even though it is not shown physically) the years passing. The movie spends the first 3 quarters of the movie at the prison, and you really get to know it, and it's inhabitants, very well. The character you get to know best though is Andy. He is a quiet man who keeps to himself, but there is so much more to him then that. In the twenty years he spends there he manages to earn the respect of his fellow prisoners (particularly Red), the prison guards, and the cruel warden Samuel Norton. Then one day he mysteriously disappears. Or to be exact, he escapes, the first man to ever escape from that prison. It takes him twenty years to deceive all the guards, that he is a quiet honest person, that would never try to escape. During this whole time he was planning his escape, right from the start when he asked Red if he could find him (Andy) a rock pick. It took him twenty years to do all this...hat's devotion if I've ever seen it, and that's why I loved his character. Then there's the last 15-20 minutes of the film which take place outside the prison. The last 5 minutes though, when Red (who is also a fairly likable character) decides to reunite with the escaped Andy, it becomes very emotional, and a truly beautiful piece of cinema. So people say this is the best Stephen King adaptation of them all, but I think calling this movie a Stephen King movie, is like calling The Lord of the Rings a blockbuster trilogy, it just doesn't quite cut it.In fact I simply must say that this may just be the best movie ever made. It has an excellent plot, gritty and realistic setting, a sense of hopefulness (despite being a prison movies), extremely likable, and relatable characters and an ending that can truly touch the heart and soul of many viewers.

While watching the film, you expect a different type of ending(kind of an ordinary one). But at the end you realize that this is not an ordinary movie. The movie contains a very good message for all of us. The kind of patience and hope that Andy has is simply brilliant. Morgan has done a good job too(as usual). He has done his role as \"Red\" with complete dedication. The dialogues and background music help you to get completely involved in the movie. There are two scenes which leave you with an awe! The first one is when Andy gets out of prison by travelling through the drainage pipes and then enjoys the rain falling on him. And the second one is at the end when Red is released from the prison and Andy waits for him at a beach. My favorite dialogue is \"Remember Red, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies.\" \n",

      "The story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest bus-load of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods. But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a \"prison drama\" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word \"redemption\" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine. The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. \n",

      "In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were \"just happy to be nominated.\" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all- time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word \"go,\" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on \"that 'Rickshaw' movie.\" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, \"it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale.\" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; \"In here's where you need it most,\" he says. \"You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch.\" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking \"that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass\" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it. \n",

Things are happening you don't expect and that's good for a movie. It's also a dark prison-film and i like that type of films. The voice of Morgan Freeman is also very nice, and intimidating. The IMDb-rating is very high. I think the movie deserves it, but i understand other people who are thinking that this movie is overrated. I think the reason why is that this movie has less haters then other movies like Pulp Fiction, and so on... .One point can be better: the characters doesn't become older when the movie progresses.But a well-deserved 10/10. \n",

      "One of the classic movie ever made. Lots of enthusiasm is shown in the movie, apart from all the suffering prisoners have to face. Must watch movie. Still capturing the box office. Shawshank is a true story and a must watch for any new member. Tim Robbins has done a fantastic job including Morgan Freeman. The Story line of the movie is really more biased then any other top bench marking movie. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people \"will\" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemtion ReviewThe Shawshank Redemption is my favourite film for many reasons. Adapted from a Stephen King novella, the film is executed brilliantly and expertly directed by Frank Darabont. The film is sad yet uplifting and has many iconic scenes. The writing is almost perfect with all the characters being well-developed. The film keeps us informed as to the lead characters' thoughts and emotions. The score was incredible with Roger Deakins cinematography and it was beautifully portrays 19 years of life in a corrupt and brutal prison. Tim Robbins delivers an incredible performance, as does Morgan Freeman. All of the supporting cast were great from the Warden to Captin Hadley. The film's ending is perfect, moving and justice for Andy delivers the feel good factor. It's a powerful film which should have dominated the Oscars. \n",

We sometimes see some things as impossible, but with persistence and determination, we can achieve something. The story of the movie is really shocking. We may find it boring on the early part but you would just surprise on the turn of events as the movie plays through. You will really would not believe that a certain person could make a hole so long that you can make a way out. I can't still imagine how the main character made it. Well in life nothing is impossible as long as we want it happen. We must only believe of what we can do so we can be productive and successful. This movie is really worth watching.

      "This isn't the type of movie that I would normally rave about. It's about the triumph of hope over despair, and friendship over division - it's a feel good movie.But the truth is I think The Shawshank Redemption is absolutely fantastic. When I try to put my finger on why I like this more than other feel good movies, I think it's largely because of the wonderful collision of brilliant characterisation and top-class performing that is Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins.The character of Andy - humble but steely, quiet but intelligent, simple but cunning - is just perfect for this movie. He's so different to almost any other prison break character you can imagine, and extremely engaging. And Tim Robbins is the perfect casting - he puts in the performance of a lifetime.Tim is very well supporting by Morgan Freeman as Red, and in fact the entire supporting cast does their job.The plot is interesting - it consists of a series of successes and falls for Andy. He keeps on picking himself and dusting himself down. You end up assuming that it's all going to end tragically, which I suppose why his final, spectacular triumph is so uplifting. Yes, it's unrealistic, but it certainly won me over! \n",

It also reminded me of the series The Oz, Its cool and all, but there's this mainstream way of showing jail and high school as the same in Hollywood a lot. probably so but i'm afraid that not to be true.And one more thing i noticed was that viewers seems to be confused a number of times as the story slips from one another scene and is really complicated. that is it started as a man who have been betrayed by his love to who've been framed then jailed bitched from there and rules there becomes everyone's favorite and the warden becomes his worst enemy and teaches him a lesson while he was on the go. \n",

      "There is a reason the Shawshank Redemption has been at #1 of the IMDb top 250 for as long as I can remember. It is probably the best movie that has ever been made. Not because of the thrilling special effects (it hardly has any). Not because of the daring, experimental innovations it has brought us (it is a quite straightforward movie). But because of its simple, beautiful storyline and its great characters.\"They send you here for life. That's exactly what they take.\" The strength of this movie is that Darabont is able to show what it means to completely lose are perspective and dreams for the future. To show how the people inside shed off their old lives and get used to the terrible life in Shawshank prison. We can truly understand how a man can become 'institutionalized.' How people get used to living under a repressive regime and can't face changing it. We see how the old Brooks can't deal with the world around him and commits suicide. How Red faces the same challenges when he can't take a leak without asking permission. Inside the joint these men had a certain standing, they were important people. Being set free is not easy when your live has been taken from you.\"Why did you do it? - I didn't, since you ask. - You gonna fit right in.\"Half of the movie we don't know for sure whether Andy is guilty or not. It doesn't matter so much. What is important is not his past. Rehabilitated? What does that word even mean? In prison you live a whole different life. With whole different rules. Without a past. Or a future. Andy is the exemption. He shows us the remedy against becoming institutionalized. By never accepting our destiny. By never giving up. By always keeping our dreams alive.\"- There are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. There is something inside that they can't touch. - What are you talking about? -Hope. - Let me tell you something my friend, hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. You better get used to that idea.\"But Andy doesn't get used to that idea. He has received two things by the warden. \"Discipline and the bible.\" And he uses these two things to get out and escape to the paradise called Zihujataneo. There are two things that make this movie so extremely good. The first thing is that we all can relate to Andy. \"I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. He had a quit way about him. A walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.\"Andy is a normal guy. He is smart, he is doing good. But he is not extremely strong, or extremely smart, or extremely rich. In other words: he is us. He is elevated a little bit above the criminals in prison, but his two most important characteristics are characteristics that, deep down inside us, we all have: hope and determination. These two emotion are so strong and so pure, that we all love to see the live of Andy. That is what makes this movie so appealing.And by living just your live as best as you can, by never giving up and by keeping your dignity at all times, we see that we can inspire people. Brooks was here. So was Red. Red didn't choose that path of Brooks. Red hasn't become completely institutionalized. Because he lived with Andy and dreamed a bit of his dreams.We, the normal movie-watchers, have never been to prison. And certainly, there is nobody who can play the role of an older brother as the great Morgan Freeman, and this might be his best performance of his live. Darabont shows a lot of skill in movie-directing and can let years pass in his movie without one moment losing our attention. There is a great soundtrack, which breathes the smell of Southern America into our living rooms. But I'm convinced that what makes this movie so great is that it inspires us all.We are not stuck in a prison, but certainly we can be stuck in our lives. Change is hard and also outside of prison it is possible to become institutionalized. We can have a life that seems to have no past and not future. That seems to be unrelated to all the other things that happen in the world. Andy learns us to never give up. To never lose faith. To always keep hoping and dreaming about paradise.\"I guess it comes down to a simple choice. Get busy living or get busy dying.\" \n",

Although it did not great at the box office yet critics praised it well, years later people discovered it on VHS. I wished i seen this film earlier as a teenager as it would have struck to me even more through a time i felt depressed and sad. A discovered this movie in the local library and rented it as i heard of the film being very good and after seeing it, it is more than just good. I may be over-exaggerating this brilliance of the film but it unlike many other films (except the lion king of the return of the king hit me right in the soft spot). I didn't cry at the end, i smiled at the end. What a film.The good of the film, the acting from freeman. Although he lost to hanks in Forrest gump for best actor, i don;t care as hanks did as much as a good job as freeman did (if better). Tim Robbins was also amazing and likable with the supporting cast doing perfection to the highest level. The score is beautiful, the mies en scene, the scripting writing is gold and genius making this a classic. This film is not complex and it is something that makes it just so darn good. The pacing is perfect and the narration from freeman is timeless. The iconic shots of Andy raising is hands in the air after escape is timeless as and should be attempted when finishing school (as i have did).A film highly recommend by me and others as well, touched me to the point of joy and laughter and will bloom your day as it always will live as cinemas most beloved classic ever. 5/5 \n",

      "What can I add to all the other reviews here? Just my own feelings about this. I now realise I watched the film in one of the hardest times, emotionally, I can remember in my life. Thoughts chasing themselves around in my head, heartbroken, paranoid and not well physically. Total mess.My dear female friend who got me through it all told me this was a film to watch. I initially resisted, thinking it was going to be lightweight, PC fare. I don't know why I thought that.There's a lacklustre opening sequence -I think. Then you get to see what kind of performance Morgan Freeman is going to turn out this time, and you start to be interested. Then this extraordinary scene flying over the prison, and I think by then you're hooked.This scene is deeply moving, not least because of the music. It's difficult to see how Thomas Newman's music for this film could possibly be bettered - perfectly listenable to in it's own right, but when you do you're reminded of the boys on the roof in the sun, enjoying their first beer for so long. They've been touched by Andy's kindness. Sometimes a kindness is thrown back in one's face, but other times a gesture of gratitude is given back - like Haywood getting up and offering Andy one of his beers - and a powerful connection is made. The film is full of great hardships and unbearable sadness - surely scars that can never completely heal or be forgotten. But it is also full of joy and fun and hope. To capture all the above in a film is a triumph. I started watching the film fairly closed to feeling, but as I watched the end I could not contain my tears, unusually.So a moment when a film came along at the right time for me, and no doubt for many others \n",

      "Plot: Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker, convicted of a murder he did not commit and sent to Shawshank prison. After two months of being there, he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) 'a man who knows how to get things'. The warden (Bob Gunton) uses Andy's banking skills for his scams and turns out to be more ruthless than he thought. Andy spends twenty years in prison before his legendary escape.This is said to be the best film ever made. I can see why. It is defiantly my favourite film of all time. Some say it is too over rated and that might be true but there's no doubt it is a fantastic and well executed film. The acting is good. Morgan Freeman is an excellent narrator. William Sadler is also good. You can't help but laugh with Haywood.The Shawshank Redemption is a brilliant story of, hope, friendship and obviously redemption. It also has a way of connecting with the viewer's experiences. People relate their own life to the film and it helps people deal with bad moments it their lives. This is not a film to miss. \n",

      "I avoided seeing this film for years because I thought it was a grim prison uprising tale from Stephen King. Well, I was one third right, it is set in a prison but it is a very good story about friendship, honesty, forgiveness/redemption, patience and loyalty. I'm going to really try and not give away too much of the film because if you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out on a great story. It's set in a prison in the late 40's. Some of the inmates have been there since the early part of the 20th century and with repeated parole denials and no rehabilitation in sight, many have been institutionalized and have lost hope and even lost sight of their own identity. When one such inmate is released, he walks into a world that he barely recognizes. He tries but in the end, fails to make it in the real world and succumbs to desperation and hopelessness. We see some of the guards greedily taking part in violence that is so vicious that it is difficult to discern the prisoners from the prison staff. But, ultimately it is a tale of redemption and the story unfolds with hardship, humor and grace. This is a film that I will see again and again. \n",

      "Stephen King is my favourite author and I like most of his books and love some as well. One of the defining features of his books is the characterisation and the atmosphere. No one does it better. This leads to his books being long and slow some times but that's the part of it. This normally doesn't transfer well to cinema where everything is cut and compressed. This movie is better than the book. I read the book and I was impressed I saw the movie and I fell in love with it.The movie focuses on the two main characters and the side stories enhances their character brilliantly. All what comes before ties in to the end. One of the greatest effect in the movie along with the atmosphere is the soundtrack. It plucks at you, it pulls at you and it lulls you in to a world where all that you see flows with it, smiles with it and cries with it.I wont talk about the story since now after so many reviews we are at a stage where we can talk about other features of this movie. There are many great moments in the movie including the two stage ending, both stages immensely enjoyable every time for different reasons. Another great moment for me is the release of Brooks Hatlen from prison. His dialogue delivery (",

      "\" The same fear can be glimpsed when Red glances fearfully over a stone wall in Buxton to see if he is being pursued or spied upon while he reads a letter. (Great acting and direction) This movie is about hope and friendship. Those of us who have seen it many times, enough to even forget the count are touched by it every time. We now see the movie in its entirety and every magical scene is impressed upon our memory because this is art. The message of eternal hope is wonderfully characterised in Andy and that of friendship in Red. \n",

      "The first time I watched this film I was on a coach heading to the french Alps in year 8 of school. I loved it from the first moment. A few weeks later when I discovered the title of the film I went out and brought it, (or more correctly had it brought as I wasn't old enough). It remains one of my favourite films in my collection.Why do I think this is one of the best films ever, it comes down to the telling of a great story, in a great way, by great actors. From the moment the film begins your sucked in, the audience is made to connect with the events we see on screen thanks to the soulful voice of the great Morgan Freeman, he has the ability to help us relate with events and almost forget we are watching a film, but instead listening to a story from a much loved grandparent. When he speaks the audience definitely listens.However Morgan is by no means the star. The less well known but equally talented Tim Robbins, his performance of Andy Dufresne, is in my opinion one of the all time greats. The way in which the character attempts to retain dignity and his humanity, instead of being twisted into the archetypal convict is reason enough for this film to be in the IMDb top 250. The way at which Dufresne strives to improve his and the other convicts leaves you with a taste on the honourably of the character, or his rebellious acts toward the Warden just to provide the inmates with a piece of music is a scene which you remember just because of its shear brilliance. Which reminds me big thanks to Steven King for writing the book this film was based on, you did good, like you normally do.No one could review this film without mentioning James Whiymore who plays the tragic figure of Brookes, the old lovable inmate. The sad tale of the man who had spent his life in prison and dies in freedom is the emotional heart of the film, I feel sad every time I watch it. James Whitmore was truly a great actor, this film proves it. Th story never gets tedious no matter how many time you watch it, and if its your first time watching be set for a treat.The best thing I can say about this film is watch it, and the only problem you'll have is trying to get across to your friends exactly why the need to see this great piece of cinema \n",

This movie has the heart & soul to be a favourite for a long time to come.I like the reality of the unfairness of the whole situation. There is no glossing over the painful stuff. He was innocent but still jailed. He did get raped. His chance DID get wiped out to have his story confirmed. What a waste.I read some people calling this a 'feel-good' story. Perhaps in the end, but other than the relief of freedom, there wasn't much to feel good about. Talk about a hard-fought battle. And it isn't even over... His life is better than it was, but still sucks considering everything he lost, considering he can never go back, considering he is always a fugitive...If you're feeling bummed out about your own life, this is a good movie to watch to realize that things could always be worse. \n",

      "When you get two life sentences, maybe you are in total despair especially you are innocent. But the banker Andy was not. He still had a hope for his future. He thought every possible way to get out of the prison. When the hope that recovered his innocence openly broke out, he decided to escape from the prison with his way. He was quite a smart person. Even his friend Red did not know his escape plan. He did it. So Red too. Their reunion at the beach was the warmest scene in the movie.Although the movie got many academy nominees, it got nothing in the end. However it won the heart of people. I think that its positive connotation is enough to move every one. That is why it is still so popular after 11 years. We should not abandon hope at any circumstance. Without hope, without future.Tim Robbins convincingly played the sympathizing banker. His another impressive movie was The player. Morgan Freeman should have won the academy award. If that happened, he did not have to wait 11 years to get the award (best supporting actor for Million dollar baby).A movie can bring you hope. 8/10 \n",

      "\"The Shawshank Redemption\" or \"Shawshank\" as I'm sure it's said to death in the film is an elongated short story that just 'lingers' from one hour to the next. There's no real 'charm' to the film except of course 'dry wit' from Red as if it's the gospel according to Red. He basically plugs Andy the entire movie as if he's his agent. \"Now Andy this\" and \"Andy that\". Not to mention a walking brochure for penitentiaries \"Shawshank this\" and \"Shawhank that\" his gospel just never lets up.Now Tim Robbins was perfectly cast for about 5 minutes playing 'the babe in the woods' who \"looks like a stiff breeze would blow him over\" a \"tall drink of water with a silver spoon up his ass\". But once nothing seems to break him, its definitely a part for Mel Gibson. Tim Robbins didn't have the 'acting chops' to bring the 'required depth' to this character. Fortunate for Robbins in post production Morgan Freeman saved his ass with extensive voice overs. Most people think this was premeditated but 'the truth' is Robbins gave such a wooden performance it was necessary.Most people think this isn't your average prison drama ether because its not about violence and melodrama. But 'the truth' is this film is no better than your TV movie of the week that features a 'prison escape'. The whole 'poster thing' couldn't be more 'implausible' if an elephant hang from a cliff by a daisy. Don't let me get started on how he just happened to have the cell on the end ether! The music was 'elevator music' at best. The only time I even took notice was when they actually featured it in the plot And even then if I'd heard it id have personally punctured my eardrums. Why the 'sound' was nominated for an academy award is beyond me. If it weren't for packaging and distribution this film would be a made for TV movie. Which it was if you consider its box office taking against home rental.The entire cast reeked 'cartoon'. You have your 'evil' warden with his 'religion'. You have your 'mean' guards you 'grow to love'. Not to mention 'the kid', 'the old guy', 'the black guy' and 'the guys'. The prison was so stereotypical it even had 'fags'. Some other failings of this 'pathetic' movie. The dialogue was 'harebrained'. If it was supposed to fascinate, well, it 'failed'. The manner in which the mini stories unfolded was 'not stimulating'. His ability to get beers and do taxes in particular 'sucked'.In short this film 'sucked'. Worst film 'since', well since ever! \n",

      "At the time of this review, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is the number one movie on IMDb. Why? If anything, it is probably the most clichéd film I have ever seen with my own two eyes, and yet it is rated as the top film of all time? It blows my mind every time I visit this website.This 'film' was adapted from a novel by the renowned author Steven King. I have not read the book, as I have already been spoiled by the movie, but apparently the writing is quite exquisite. However, Frank Darabont must have missed the entire point of Steven's works, which is to have engaging characters that you are able to sympathize with.The characters are so bland, I might as well be staring at glue dry. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's bromance literally develops right out of the blue after they have one conversation. Pacing? What's that? Later, you meet an old fart named Brooks, who might as well have his name changed to \"I'm going to die later so feel sad-larry\", and the most he contributes to the film is increasing the runtime with his sub-plot about being outside after being locked in for so long. One cannot forget the oh-so-memorable (sarcasm) warden who channels the spirits of every Disney villain without the accompanying song. You can find more interesting characters in a Tyler Perry movie.The worst part of the movie is definitely the passage of time. The story takes place over twenty years or so and yet the only one to actually age is the warden. Tim and Morgan stay in some special cells where they magically do not get older and therefore nobody notices on IMDb. While a competent director would have noticed this as soon as they glanced at the script, Darabont was off in the broom closet shagging the catering chick or something.If you enjoy modern shooters then you are in for a treat. Most of this movie is full of grays, browns, mixes between, and it even has a sewer section just for the hell of it. Just when you thought the movie might get interesting when out of the prison, prepare to be disappointed. Honestly, the best shot of the movie is when Tim is crawling through sh*t, as it reflects on my feelings towards the film.Music can make - or break - a movie. Here, the 'original' score only seems to try and make you cry at the most inappropriate times. The music is too overplayed in films like this, where it takes away from the already terrible experience.This movie is as lame as they come. If you like this, fine.

I mean how many times have we seen a movie about some guy, in this case Andy Defresne played by Tim Robbins, being sent to prison because he murdered his wife and then many years later he escapes using a spoon or something to escape from the prison. The acting isn't really great, the story is flat like a pancake, and Frank Darabont's direction really shows that this was a first-time effort. The movie is absolutely WAY too predictable, the title The Shawshank Redemption already gives away the ending of the movie, which I felt way too cheesy and fake to believe. In conclusion, I don't see how this movie even got the Best Picture nomination back in '94, I guess the Academy felt sorry for this film.

I can only assume it has been voted as such because people liked the \"shocking\" ending and the happiness brought to them by Morgan Freeman's voice caressing their ears.There is also a seriously unpleasant rape scene in there, none of the characters do very much, and there is a particularly depressing suicide scene.

      "The Shawshank Redemption 'Get busy living, or get busy dying.' (Darabont, 1994). These insightful words changed the cinema experience forever. In 1994, Frank Darabont released his ninth film, The Shawshank Redemption, just one of his cinematic triumphs. This film tells a story of an unlikely friendship between an innocent man Andy Dufrense, sentenced for two murders and a convicted murder, Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding. Together they hope to one day become free men and experience life outside the prison walls. This is a film that touches every viewer's heart, a movie that has changed many lives. The Shawshank Redemption is renowned as being a landmark movie by association of the characters, crimes and confessions that played major roles in the film's success. The actors chosen for this film are one of the main reasons as to why this movie was so successful. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman play the two leading roles throughout The Shawshank Redemption. As well as a main character throughout the film, Morgan Freeman also narrates a vast quantity of the film. Morgan Freeman won several awards for best actor and best supporting actor for his part in The Shawshank Redemption. Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrense, the innocent man wrongly jailed. The two characters become instantly believable from the first time they meet. Red bets 10 cigarettes that Andy will be the first to break, Andy however defies Reds statement. This bond becomes inseparable. The opening scene is of Andy being sentenced in a courtroom, the camera changes between Red in prison and Andy travelling to the prison until the two separate stories collide. The viewers meet Red and his mates and soon become emotionally attached. Together they grow to accept their fate and they battle the daily challenges that prison has to offer. Andy hides the secret that will change everyone's lives, until one night during a storm. Andy escapes from the Shawshank Prison through a hole, he takes the books containing the bank details from the warden. The cinematography excellence that is displayed constantly throughout this film is strongly displayed once Andy has finally escaped. The camera goes from being a low angle that follows Andy through the sludge to a high Angle allowing us to see Andy with his outstretched arms. This is quite possibly the most powerful scene in the entire film. Andy makes a new life for himself as Randall Stevenson. The Shawshank Redemption taught us all that there's more than meets the eye in everything we do. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the first movies to have an entire story line based off a successful prison escape. This film exposed what prison is actually like and how prisoners are treated. The Shawshank Redemption also debunked how you were guilty until proved innocent. Frank Darabont rids your imagination of what ifs and replaces it with when. The Shawshank Redemption uses the posters, given to Andy as presents from Red, to cover the hole that would ignite Andy Dufrense big escape. It is once that Andy has wriggled out of his prison cell one night that he finally has the chance to escape. With each clap of thunder, Andy strikes the sewage pipe with a rock until he finally breaks through, he then crawls for 500 yards through sewage. Andy Dufrense escapes the Shawshank prison to live a new life as Randall Stevenson. Although an iconic landmark movie, The Shawshank Redemption did not receive a single Oscar or Golden Globe. The film received 36 award nominations and went on to win 19 of these nominations. This stop motion picture was a box office success, making a profit of over $28 million. Having spent just $25 million of the making of this movie, the overall profit wasn't bad. The responses from this film were overwhelming positive. Many views stated the fact that this was a movie that will never be forgotten. And how although written by Stephen King, it is unlike any of his other cinematic triumphs. Frank Darabont did extraordinary job of replicating Stephen Kings Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The similarities between the book and the movie are defiantly a stand out, however there was one difference that stunned us all. Why did the movie and the book have different titles? Frank Darabont intentionally changed the name of the movie as he believed with the same name as the book, it would turn some people away. This was as a because of Rita Hayworth's name in the title, however Frank Darabont did completely rid the film of Rita. Instead he incorporated it into the film by it being the very poster that hides the hole that Andy escapes from. The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic successful that has changed the film industry. The Shawshank Redemption is an iconic landmark film that has changed cinema forever. The characters, crimes and confessions from this film have changed the way we see daily objects. The actors chosen to partake in their roles did exceptionally well, making the film so successful. The Shawshank Redemption is a film that is never going to go out of style. It will forever remain in the forefront of viewers minds. \n",

      "THIS is what movies are all about! A magnificent story, first-class actors, a superbly talented director, plus all the necessary attendant and supporting talents including set design, lighting, music, scripting, and all else that is required in the mix to create a masterpiece. Not a moment of the film is wasted, no segment too short or too long: it is all \"just right\". Who would have thought that a story about men in a cruel prison system could be developed into a memorable movie with many marvellous messages. May I single out one of my favourite actors, James Whitmore? I cannot imagine anyone else more suited to the role than he. In fact, the casting in this epic is remarkable: all parts ideally filled with class actors. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, is not one of my screen favourites, but it's impossible to find any fault with him, and somehow he puts his mark on the role and makes it his. Tim Robbins is perfect; each time I see this film, I appreciate his acting more and more. It's so easy to give Shawshank Redemption a TEN. Surely anything less would be an injustice? Yes, Virginia, there IS a Santa Claus ! \n",

      "Brooks' release from Shawshank is considered as one of the most brilliant moments in the Visual of Emotions. - Brooks, one of the oldest inmates at Shawshank is led out on parole after 50 years terrified at the prospect of freedom. Now, Pay attention to how the filmmakers visually communicate isolation .................... -In a sequence that ends with the words \"Brooks Was Here\" permanently etched into the very rafters from which he hangs, doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to deduce that this is a sequence about recognition of one's existence in an uncaring world or rather the lack thereof. Now, we've got the music, we've got the heart wrenching voice of narration, we've got James Whitmore's (Brooks) expressive face. But even if you take that all away, Frank Darabont (The Director) and Roger Deakins (The Cinematographer) are still saying something on the screen, and while we love the shot of an absurdly big halfway house room swallowing Brooks up in the Loneliness of too much space. And the shot of him hanging himself from a symbol so immediately obvious. I'm willing to break the rule of not dissecting symbols because films aren't Da Vinci Code ciphers, They're emotional experiences we're looking at. Which strikes his most clever is how Darabont and Deakins managed to make Brooks and us as the audience feel alone in a crowded space. -In a shot he's absolutely boxed in by background actors every single one of them is pointed away from him with their eye lines pointing outwards such that he is compositionally surrounded by their backs. In fact, this visual trope holds true for almost the entire sequence. You can see it when he was about to bump into a car and the man yelling at him in the car is kept off the screen. And established in the quite literal turning point when he left the prison. Another scene from the manager of the supermarket only turns his body towards him to scold Otherwise, It's all backs. And in the bus scene if we rotated the heads of the actors in the background towards Brooks. I mean it's not exactly a pleasant emotion, the actors all have relatively negative expressions but it's certainly not isolating or lonely anymore, we'd go with persecuting and accusatory and with a small edit we've changed this entire feeling of the scene in a single frame which says a whole hell of a lot about how much these little details can matter, we're not even focused on these other actors, you have to point us to an emotion in an instant which isn't always easy to do. In precisely staged images can be evocative of mostly nothing but carefully planned imagery can save volumes simply by something as simple as the way a person is pointed in the background which is exactly why I think Shawshank gets this moment exactly right. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate, Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring Samar as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze DI Figaro by Mozart. \n",

      "This film really has the philosophical hat on its head - especially that of Existentialism. It explores beautifully the idea that we make our own meaning in this world, and that being given an essence by others - the prison, jailers, and the satanic warden in this case - really deprives us of basically what makes us human, our ability to make choices. Andy's escape can be seen as a metaphor for the acceptance of existentialism and of making your own choices - using one's radical freedom as Jean Paul Satre would put it. While Red serves as a loose representative of the idea of essentialism. I feel ambivalent about the famous quote from this film which goes, \"Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\" I am not sure I agree. But in my own way, I can see the idea behind it. Hoping is a sure cause for suffering, and mastering that suffering - as Friedrich Nietzsche would say - is the roadway to happiness. The people who can't endure this suffering may not be all that admirable - Red, for instance. It is maybe Andy's endurance and mastering of his suffering that makes him admirable and compelling as a protagonist. The redemption in the title is symbolic of the release of inauthentic and externally imposed meaning, and the act of embracing authentic meaning. In short, this film is one of those films that get you thinking about life; it has all the entertainment, symbolism, and Philosophical depths that you could need to make the most of your time. It's definitely worth it! \n",

      "The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is about a Wrongly convicted, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in in Maine's Shawshank prison for the murders of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy learns to get by in the brutal confines of prison, even earning the respect of his fellow inmates, most notably the long time convict \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman). While being an R rated film I didn't feel like it was an R rated film. I mean there were some scenes, other than that it could've been rated a PG-13, but it's not up to me. The Drama/Crime film was surprising on first view but in the best world, I literally watched it straight after I watched for the first time, although it does have a running time of 142 minutes. It was well worth it. I now know some of the most iconic scenes ever in film history, I knew them before but I never understood until I watched it for the first time. I think one of the most touching and in terms of the film itself, one of the biggest scenes was the death of Brookes. I wasn't able to handle it, you know that feeling you get when you're watching a film and you can kind of guess what's about to happen but you don't want it to happen, so you're sat there like no, no, no, no, no, you know? In the film it becomes clear that the prison is corrupt with inside deals and businesses going on, it is also revealed to the audience that the prison does not follow the prison standards of the state and that it does what it wants. Such as, when on the first night Andy is in his cell and all of the other prisoners tell him and are talking about who there is always one who cracks first, it turns out to be a guy only a few cells away from Andy, we then see how the guards deal with the situation in a sarcastic manner and how they blatantly don't care at all, as they proceed to actually club the guy to death. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (\"looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over\"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison. . We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. \"I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,\" he tells Red. \"Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'.\" The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles? The movie avoids lingering on Andy's suffering; after beatings, he's seen in medium and long shot, tactfully. The camera doesn't focus on Andy's wounds or bruises, but, like his fellow prisoners, gives him his space. There's an underlying problem. Behind bars, Red is king. He's the prison fixer, able to get you a pack of cigarettes, a little rock pick or a Rita Hayworth poster. On the outside, he has no status or identity. We've already seen what happened to the old librarian (James Whitmore), lonely and adrift in freedom. The last act, in which Andy helps Red accept his freedom, is deeply moving - all the more so because Andy again operates at a distance, with letters and postcards, and is seen through Red's mind. Roger Deakins' cinematography is tactful, not showy. Two opening shots, one from a helicopter, one of prison walls looming overhead, establish the prison. Shots follow the dialogue instead of anticipating it. If you have not seen this film, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!?!?!!? Follow me on Instagram @gabewatling and Twitter @gmwatling \n",

To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.

These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.

      "The story may sound simple, but the truth behind the words is remarkable. When I heard the name of the film first time, I considered the Shawshank to be a man' name, but in fact it is a jail's namea hell in the world. Not only for the inhumanity of the prisonthey behaved brutally; but also for the jail gnawed at people' heart by keeping them waiting and waiting as life passed. It seemed that only those utterly worthless people who gave up everything could survive. That's where the story happened. The part impressed me most is when Andy got out of the jail. He extended his arms in front of him in the heavy rain as if he were welcoming the fresh air and the freedom. At that moment, I saw the confidence win the darkness, discharging light dazzling the eyes in the dark blue sky. Under the light, I could feel my recreant heart being shivering as his voice said: \"Remember, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies!\" That's why I like this film: it encourages people to fight to preserve the dignity of human beings, to appreciate the beauty of life, and the most importance is to keep hope forever. He once that is born, that is die. Everyone is the same. The only difference is whether busy living or busy dying. The film tells us that even a man can live once, but if he keeps confidence, keeps hope and works his life right, then once is enough. The freedom is the bird that feels the light when the dawn is still dark, the hope is the chief happiness that this world affords, and the life should be full of the singing of the bird and the happiness hope brings. ＂ What's that do you think? It's the trembling of the heart, the singing of the mind, the flying of the soul and the hope to be free.\" \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a film that is continuously moving forward; a stream of characters and narrative arcs are put into the foreground for around 20 minutes each, in each of these, a different aspect of prison life is conveyed, and occasionally, the tone is entirely different from the previous one; despite this, the film avoids feeling anthology-like with a consistent setting.Shawshank Prison feels living and breathing from the moment it first appears on the screen; via the forever-moving background characters, and the varied environments inside and outside of the prison! Shawshank itself is one of the most interesting things about this film, and quite possibly why it appeals to so many people; prison is an inherently interesting location to set a film; much like a school or workplace setting; there is a sense of order: people's routines are controlled by people above them - Shawshank combines the relatability of this with the crime and drama of a courtroom or heist film.Please have a nice day, and enjoy the film! \n",

      "A sullen Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) sets the mood for this seventh and penultimate of Harry Potter. \"These are dark times, there's no denying,\" he intones gravely, pointing out the grim state of affairs facing the nation- murders, disappearances and raids- but reassuring the public, as any politician would, that his Ministry has it all under control. Of course, he is only bluffing, and it doesn't take long before the palpable sense of doom and despair convinces you otherwise. Welcome back to the magical world of Harry Potter, one that began with wonder and joy, but has since become shrouded in death and darkness. Still visibly distraught from the death of his mentor Professor Albus Dumbledore, Harry is now tasked to continue with the mission of the late Dumbledore- to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes (accursed objects containing fragments of Voldemort's soul). It doesn't get any easier, since Voldemort is nearing the height of his powers, and his bidders have infiltrated the bureaucracy to paint Harry as a wanted criminal. There are fewer and fewer allies around- even those within the Order of the Phoenix may have since betrayed their ranks- and the first half hour quickly establishes the danger and urgency of the situation at hand. Members of the Order, including Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), attempt to escort Harry to safety- but even that mission is met with an attack from the Death Eaters, culminating in a exciting high-speed flying-bike chase that shouldn't disappoint fans looking for some action sorely missed in the last movie \n",

      "Shawshank was a brilliant story that had every right to be retold on the silver screen. Its main theme is corruption, which I often find myself enjoying. Corruption is a slow process, but it's very impactful once you notice it's happening. I love subtle changes like that. The moment of realization for me was Tommy's death. Looking back on it now, there were plenty of tells that the warden was abusing his power, even before this scene. But like I said, power corrupts slowly. So slowly, you don't even notice it happening until something drastic happens, and this movie perfectly captured that concept! Props to Stephen King for creating such a well-thought-out story! \n",

      "The experience of a hot-shot banker named Andrew Dufresne played by Tim Robbins. After being sentenced to 2 life terms for the killing of his wife and her lover, Andy then finds himself to be an inmate at the Shawshank prison. For a crime, he swears he didn't commit. The movie is centered around Andy's journey as an inmate in the prison, the brutal beatings and harassments, and changes he experiences. Where Andy meets another lifer, Ellis \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman, mistakenly picks him as the new prisoner that will most likely crack under the pressures of prison. After the beating and killing of one of the new inmates (fishes) Andy still does not break. Reds ability to obtain wanted objects helps establish a friendship between him and Red. This friendship leads to many prison adventures and later events help him and he gains respect from his friends, staff, and the warden.Motifs displayed in the film are Corruption and crime. The idea of the prison should be the rehabilitation of men. However, instead the prison is focuses and praises corruption, greed, and money laundering. Andy's quick willingness to launder money for the Warden Norton played by Bob Gunton showed his survival skills and need to protect himself. The editors use of voice-overs and flash backs sets the scenes for viewers allowing them to be able to see the events of the prison.My thematic ideas of the film are Isolation and imprisonment, which seems to be a large focus of the film. The bars, strict schedules, horrible guards are just some of the reason for isolation. The film shows a lot of people taking advantage of the system for their own gain, from Red, who smuggles anything into the prison. All the way to the Warden, who benefits from forced prison labor and money laundering. However, the power of hope is Andy's main driver throughout his experience in prison. Andy attempts to maintain his self-worth and idea of getting out one day. Tunneling his way through the concrete cell wall. Hope is all that Andy has left. \n",

      "In 1947 Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy is befriended by contraband smuggler, Ellis \"Red\" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer and later a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly assaulted by \"the Sisters\" and their leader, Bogs.In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance, and offers to help him legally shelter the money. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is then transferred to another prison. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the Warden begins using Andy to handle matters for a variety of people, including guards from other prisons and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters asking the state government for funds to improve the decaying library.In 1954, Brooks is paroled, but cannot adjust to the outside world after fifty years in prison, and commits suicide by hanging himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in him receiving solitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains that hope is what gets him through his time, a concept that Red dismisses. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. He has Andy launder the money using the alias Randall Stephens.In 1965, Tommy Williams is incarcerated for burglary. He is befriended by Andy and Red, and Andy helps him pass his GED exam. In 1966, Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for the murders for which Andy was convicted. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but he refuses to listen and sends Andy back to solitary confinement when he mentions the money laundering. Norton has Hadley murder Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy declines to continue the laundering, but relents after Norton threatens to burn the library, remove Andy's protection from the guards, and move him to worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months, and tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican coastal town. Red feels Andy is being unrealistic, but promises Andy that if he is ever released, he will visit a specific hayfield near Buxton, Maine, and retrieve a package Andy buried there. He worries about Andy's well-being, especially when he learns Andy asked another inmate to supply him with six feet (1.8 meters) of rope.The next day at roll call, the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the last 19 years. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, using the rope to bring with him Norton's suit, shoes, and the ledger containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens and visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money, then mails the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. FBI agents arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid his arrest.After serving forty years, Red is finally paroled. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited. \n",

The year 1947, the location New England, Maine, United States of America. No titles over the picture necessary. A long and steady dolly-out shot by cinematographer Roger Deakins alongside a parked vintage car's driver door opens \"The Shawshank Redemption\" accompanied with a muffled radio song, setting the tone for music arranged by composer Thomas Newman. Voice-Over send out from a court room hearing in which Andy stands trail for murdering his wife and her lover at a golf country club. A Flashback scene between the two lovers is used by Director Frank Darabont to visualize Andy's broken heart. A life in shattered glass. Andy states the divorce with his wife should have taking place in Reno, Nevada. A long way from home to break off a life-long matrimony, covering the entire country in subconscious mind of the spectator. A prosecuting lawyer counter-strikes \"I see you in hell before I sign the divorce paper\". Andy comprehends himself that he has been upset by the betrayal. An anonymous jury unimpressed by the cold-hearten and calculated man; sending Andy to a back-to-back life sentence in an institution nearby where all familiar book of books is king.\"No sir, I learned my lesson, I'm a changed man,\" contemplates the character of Red, performed by 50 years plus Morgan Freeman, in a 16-year-old teenage boy manner, having already 20 years of prison time on his shoulders. A red-colored stamp went down on paper; rejected. Out of the dark, out of a cellar embedded in iron railings and gray concrete walls, Red walks into an open yard, regaining a throne, organizing his kingdom in dealing pleasure items to inmates. New inmates, the fresh fish; the bets are on, who is to break, who is to gain momentum. Regular sears and ravings fill a soundtrack enriched by classical score. We are flying over the walls of Shawshank prison with a helicopter before getting dragged over ground through a main gate into darkness, becoming animals in a pit. Armed surveillance mandatory in a world, where no blasphemy has a chance. \"You put your faith in the book of books and serve the lord\", the prison's warden, personalizes by actor Bob Gunton, leaves no doubts that he owns the human condition in a realm of dreamy escapology.Steaming water vapor in a laundry kitchen connects on the page, adapted from a short novel by Stephen King, as Red keeps dealing in a system of wrapped-cotton logistics. Andy gets his rock-hammer for a price. No freebies. Cigarettes are welcome as valid currency. A sisters gang out for testosterone safaris, \"They've to be human first, to be homosexual\", says Red for-seeing Andy's routine. Two years of choosing beatings over rape. Time won't wait. Roofing in springtime 1949, where beer-drinking in a setting sun becomes exemptions to Andy's character of missed out breath-works and selflessness. Closer to the edge of falling and shining with knowledge of an educated man, conquering a reign of violence by stating dialogue over money savings for head guard, played by Clancy Brown, who's character's marriage gets communicated as the state to be to secure an existence. Projection of old movies in black and white, the swaying of Hollywood star that transcends teenage wet dreams. Themes of revenge seem to breath the walls of solitary imprisonment, punishments of the hole. Reference of fairness in an unfair world, where guards avenge inmates, the new maxim of an human order where the personal benefit leads the rapture and hot spot cinematography, sharing creative grounds from Roger Deakins to Robert Richardson, for a personal talk between the Warden and Andy.The prison as microcosm for a life in chains. Growth with assignments taking on, Andy finishes project of building a library of novelty, music and art. The picture idealized prison time as profession, where one can work for living as everywhere. \"Outside the walls I have been clean as a whistle, inside the walls you learn to be a crook\" states Andy for which receives the obligatory punishment by presenting his innocence of murder to the Warden, not for-seeing that it has been too late to take sides. The living as a neutron learns the character the hard way by getting a two months solitary stretch in Shawshank's dungeon. Corridor of solitary cells captured in far side depth of field foreshadowing first ingredients towards Frank Darabont's succeeding project \"The Green Mile\" (1999).Melancholy and sentiment fill \"The Shawshank Redemption\" towards the Director's clean out come in order to present an Happy End Picture. The Warden shoots himself after being exposed to fraud and murder. Red lets go off it all in a following revision meeting protesting to evaluating supervisor, \"You stamp your form sonny, because I do not give a damn\". He pushes out the prison gate after more than 30 years as inmate, where John Ford's \"The Searchers\" (1956) presents the open range of mystical horizon to actor John Wayne, there Frank Darabont stays true to his realism transcending in collaboration with Morgan Freeman the gray of an asphalt jungle. By then Andy has escaped prison, liquidated all bank accounts, being exposed as focused war horse, digging a tunnel for 19 years with the 7 inch rock hammer despite any humiliation, leaving Red the mysteries of the world buried in earth under an weeping willow tree on a forest clearing at city named Buxton.

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a movie which is hypnotising in just how good it is.You know the type of film; whenever it's on TV (which in this case it constantly is) you have to stop what you're doing and watch it - one of those rare movies in which you don't want to end. With the all the movies out there in which you find yourself checking how long is left of the running time, here is one in which you see there is a whole hour left and you're glad; the mark of a truly great movie.Carcerophobia is the fear of going to prison and is something which has crossed my mind in the past, partially brought on by movies like The Shawshank Redemption. Even if you've committed nothing illegal like Andy Dufresne, there is always that possibility that an honest law abiding citizen could end up in the slammer. The world of Shawshank State Penitentiary is one with little to no human rights, one with shocking but believable treatment from both the guards and fellow prisoners as they engage in brutal, sadistic acts. Regardless of what prisons around the world are like circa 2017, your \"whole life (is) blown away in the blink of an eye, nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it\". The Shawshank Redemption may be one of Stephen King's non horror works, but the prospect of going to prison for a crime you never committed gets under my skin.One of the aspects of The Shawshank Redemption which intrigues me the most in the empire Andy builds while inside prison as well as an insight of the economics and commerce which goes on between the prisoners and guards. Just like Robert Stroud in Birdman of Alcatraz, he is still able to find meaning in his life despite being in what first looks like a hopeless situation; he is able to find hope in despair. This really does show that at the end of the day, knowledge is power. Likewise Andy sending a letter every week to the state government for prison library funding and ultimately playing with the system, always something which inspires me.What makes Andy Dufresne such a great character? Like Tim Robbins himself, there is more than meets the eye. Robins has an intelligence to him and you can't quite figure out what is going on behind his eyes, an actor with a mysterious aura to him and this comes through with the character of Andy. He is not like the rest of the prisoners, he's a civilised gentleman thrown into the jungle that is prison but he's not a sheltered fool ether and knows how to deal with his new surroundings. But why do I need to tell you this, the narration sums up his character perfectly in a beautiful and poetic manner - \"I must admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him; looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.\" Likewise I also find myself very intrigued by the character of Brooks; just how does such a gentle soul end up in prison? Did he really commit a crime? Who knows?Morgan Freeman has the ability to play wise old men without coming off as a stereotype or a cliché. His narration is describing what obviously appears in the film, so what makes it so great? Like the best film narration it's to do with its poetic manner and the way in which it's delivered; scenes in the film were shot to time with the pre- recorded voice over plus it goes without saying Freeman has one of the most heavenly voices ever. None of his dialogue is necessary for the advancement of the plot, yet what would the film be without it? There are just so many inspirational quotes.The escape sequence itself so incredible yet at the same time is entirely believable and one of the most satisfying movie revenge plots. Many people always point out as to how Andy could reattach the poster to the wall when he begins his escape through the tunnel, even Frank Darabont acknowledges this on the DVD audio commentary although I am puzzled as to why this is made into a big deal. Andy could simply attach the poster to the wall at the top two corners and allow gravity to cover the remainder of the hole and simply crawl into it from below as if the poster where a curtain, likewise we never see on screen if the poster has been reattached on all four corners.When I think of films which can convey an expansive range of powerful human emotions and feelings and act as a form of emotional therapy a few instantly come to my mind - It's a Wonderful Life, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Shawshank Redemption. Films which help one to break from the mental prisons of our life. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption A literary/movie reviewIt is often said that a book should not be judged by its movie; based/adapted on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption the movie The Shawshank Redemption tries to oppose this claim. Frank Darabont, the director of the movie penned the screenplay to perfection (near about!) , having acquired the filming rights from his pen-pal Stephen King. Albeit He made some changes in the screenplay from the novella , these changes make the movie more watchable! Lets say Frank took some cinematic liberty which even bettered the movie from the novella. The strong voice of Morgan Freeman narrates the movie sequences for us. The character of Freeman is an Irish (Ellis Boyd Rankine ;called as Red in the movie whole time) in novella and Frank alludes to this fact when Freeman tells Andy Dufresne, \"maybe because I'm an Irish.\" The story is obviously inspired from Leo Tolstoy 's story \"God sees the truth, but waits.\" (Andy is wrongly? accused of murdering)The film also refers to Alexandre Dumas's \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" . Actually this scene is quite comic and funny. Heywood , a fellow convict of Dufresne's reads wrongly the name of Alexandre Dumas name as dumb-ass, then Andy corrects him and tells him that the book will interest Heywood that the book \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" is also about Prison break and Red (Freeman) says jokingly that the this book should also be put under Educational pile of books. Both the book and movie tells us about a smart banker (Dufresne) who is wrongly convicted through fate for the murder of his wife and her lover in cold blood. In the mid-way of novella and the movie We are told that there might be a possibility of acquitting , but while novella disperses this possibility gently , the film does something quite different and shocking, Another cinematic liberty!! Then the through the Banker or Red , we are acquainted with the hardships and cruel practices ongoing in the Shawshank Prison. How Andy Dufresne copes with the Prison environment and find new ways of amusement as in listening to opera, setting up of huge library and teaching fellow prison members. Of course his journey is not a smooth one. A major difference in physique of Andy is depicted in the movie from the novella,where Tim Robbins is Tall and strapping , Andy in the book is average height and of weak physique which makes him prone to attack of sodomites and how he fights them back. Both book and movie make us realize the price of freedom, hope and endless patience and perseverance. Andy picks up a curious habit which he used to pursue when he was free in his home which helps him a lot as we move through. Then movie shows the usual and Cruel! Prison officers and wardens, their scheming and corruption. How Andy fights them and overwhelms them is a study and pleasure to watch or read whichever you choose.

      "It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (\"looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over\"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison. \n",

Everything is perfect, Freeman and Robbins are perfect in their roles, and even Bob Gunton in the role of master and Clancy Brown as captain Harley who both hate (the captain still looks sympathetic when he beats Bogs but the master is more than detestable). We find in this film the injustice in its pure state with Andy Dufresne twice sentenced to life imprisonment for two murders he says he didn't commit, and that he didn't commit and who is making friends with a resident who has been there for 20 years, Red, known for being \"the man who gets everything\". The ultimate injustice falls when Tommy, a \"little asshole\" who took two years for burglary, learns to Andy that a man killed his wife and her lover of, an opportunity for Andy to prove that he is not guilty. When the director asks Tommy if it is true and young man says \"yes\", he killed Tommy to protect his interests. However, Dufresne happens to escape from prison and takes all the money he had laundered for the master and he go live in Mexico after he denounced Norton, forcing him to commit suicide. This film shows us a great friendship between Freeman and Robbins but it also raises the problem of reintegration, showing us Brooks, detained for 50 years in Shawshank, not surviving the outside world and committing suicide. This film is perfect, music could be the weak point but I would just say that's not a strong point, which does not prevent the fact that this film is a masterpiece worth a 10/10!

      "The Shawshank Redemption is the first film of Frank Darabont and the best movie of all times, undoubtedly.Based in the short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank redemption' of Stephen King (the master of terror), this adaptation is the most realistic story about the hard reality in the prisons and an excellent reflect of our daily life (fear, hope, routine, justice, ambition, freedom and so on).There are many interesting and endearing characters in the story; however, I only can mention the main characters, they are: - Andy Dufresne: the main character, a man condemned to two life imprisonments for an error, however he is the most optimistic and intelligent character. - Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding: the narrator, the best friend of Andy and the person who get anything for the prisoners. - Samuel Norton: the ambitious warden of Shawshank prison and the main antagonist. - Brooks Hatlen: the old man that takes care of the library in the prison and the institutionalize man that must confront his hard reality.In the story, we can watch the main ideas of the stoic and existentialist philosophy, especially the last ideology such we can see in the Andy's actions because he looks for his liberty and he makes his destiny. For more information, anybody we can see the next video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91XDnA9z8h0.Like in Mulholland Drive, another of my favorite movies, Rita Hayworth has a great importance along of story because Andy have a poster of Rita Hayworth, he and 'Red' watch her film 'Gilda', and Stephen King uses her name, maybe as a symbol of yearning of hope.This film we can divide in nine parts: - The Andy's judgment: Andy is condemned to two life imprisonments. - The first two years: Andy must confront many problems in the prison, especially Bogs. - The ascent of Andy: Andy helps to prisoners, guardians and the warden. - The destiny of Brooks Hatlen: After 50 years in prison, Brooks leaves prison but he must face the new world. - The prison's library: Andy builds a better library in the Shawshank prison. - The Tommy's story: Andy decides to help Tommy, a new prisoner, and he will help to Andy. - The descent of Andy: Andy have problems with the warden so all needs hope. - Andy gets his freedom: Andy gets his liberty and 'Red' tell us how he did it. - 'Red' gets his freedom: 'Red' gets his liberty but he must fulfill a promise. However, the story is very fluid, so anybody could enjoy the story in all moment.The most powerful scene in the film is when finally Andy gets his freedom and he celebrates in the rain, because it represents the triumph of hope after many years, furthermore the soundtrack is excellent in that moment.Along of film, there are important sentences that invite to reflecting: - Get busy living, or get busy dying. - Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. - Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free (This sentence not appears in the film, but it is important for explain the story).This film is the best and more people must know this masterpiece of the cinema story. \n",

      "It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne \"Tim Robbins\", the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding Morgan Freeman. It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy \"looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over\", and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison. \n",

      "It's amazing that such an \"old\" movie without the theatrical super effect that we see nowadays in any action movie, is still holding strong in its reviews and critics. There is only one reason for this: SUPERB ACTING!!! While Tim Robbins appears to be the main characters and leading man, the show is being stolen again and again by Morgan Freeman. But they do complement each other so much that I could not envision this movie without both of them in their respective roles. The rest of the cast, come and go throughout the movies and bring additional drama, emotions and a greater sense of what life could be in prison, either if you are the prisoner or guard. Of course there are parts of the movie that are a bit \"far-fetched\", but you know you are watching a movie, not a real-life drama so it's easily forgiven as it brings deeper enrichment to the movie.SPOILER ALERT: My best scene is when Red (Morgan Freeman) is getting the envelope that Andy (Tim Robbins) left him by the Oak Tree. He scans around to ensure that he is not being watched and he opens the envelope very carefully, while continuing to look around to ensure no one is watching him. What an amazing actor to be able to portrait that sense of distrust of everything, after spending so much time in prison where it becomes a fact of life to always \"look over your shoulder\". I'm always in awe of his acting whenever I come upon this scene. I have seen this movie way back in 1994...and probably at least 10 more times since then...and whenever I flick channels on the TV ( in the odd time I watch \"real\" TV) and see Shawshank Redemption playing...I just can't stop myself to watch it again! \n",

      "This high budget adaptation of Stephen King's original novel, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, goes like this, a man named Andy Durfresne who is played by Tim Robbins is accused of murdering his wife, therefore he is sentenced to spend 2 life sentences in prison at the Shawshank State Penitentiary. He eventually meets and befriends a black prisoner named Ellis \"Red\" Redding who is played by Morgan Freeman is willing to help Andy deal with the downsides of being behind bars. The strength the film is the acting, you feel the emotion coming from every character, you don't feel the actors playing them, you just feel the actual characters themselves, ranging from Morgan Freeman, to Clancy Brown as Captain Hadley, and Tim Robbins. Freeman's best moments are when he's having conversations with Robbins and narrating throughout most of the film. Brown's character is a very unlikable jerk seeing that he, the other guards, and the warden treat the prisoners like animals but that's his job and he does it well. But of course we can't forget Robbins' outstanding likability, the absolute best scene in the entire film is when he breaks out of prison, stands on his knees in the river, holds his hands in the air, and praises God for his freedom, where you feel how thankful he is to finally be free.

      "\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair. The story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods. But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time. Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside. Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system. There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see. The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a \"prison drama\" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word \"redemption\" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine. The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own. Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. \n",

      "Is this movie the best film in the world? Of course not. But choosing the best film is not that easy. Should it be a movie that was both old and western like The Good the Bad and the Ugly, a mafia movie like the godfather and sometimes boring like the Godfather or a movie that could not understand everyone's issues like Pulp Fiction? Or a superhero movie like Dark Knight? These movies are not movies that everyone will like and understand. But The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that most people can easily watch and impress. So it is unwarranted to discuss it.That's why I think you have such a high score.But in the end it's a good movie.Andy Dufresne had breakfast every morning for 20 years, tackled the job he was given, killing time with his shirt and sleeping in his cell - if he did not have an extraordinary job per day. Looking at this picture, how many brave can be found that the general lines of their lives are much different? A little bigger, but do we live in a big, reinforced concrete jail? Do we spare time because we are forced to do things that are not really relevant to our existence? Do we spend time with friends in the times that we can increase, protect ourselves against madness, and then go to sleep in a dark room? But this funky banker has a difference from our lot. Although he tried to live in accordance with the conditions he knew he could not change from his first day in prison, he never allowed his voice to be silent. He reminded himself of the fact that some of them were not convicted and worked for a world in which he set the conditions in the darkness of the darkness, in the moments when no one knew, Full 20 years! The pressures he saw were not enough to change the reality. Somewhere outside, he never forgot that life is so cold and unstable, there is a little paradise where the soul can turn its inspiration into reality.People can experience various troubles during their lifetime and can live in unhappiness for hundreds of days in a row. But remember that there is always a chance of happiness tomorrow. If you see this as a rabbit-carrot deception, it is known that maybe you are a rabbit, but the stick that the carrot is hanging is also in your hand. It is the wound that personally gives you the will. If you live in a reality illusion, you are entitled to change the direction of your precious life as long as you are breathing away.Andy Dufresne can also remind us that if the anticipation of a life that has spent almost an entire life in captivity can be reminiscent of the freedom of friend red just writing \"red was here\" once and reading it by somebody in the future. I would even go further; You are refused.The more freed you are when you are born, the more freed you are when you die. What you need to do is to fill your life with the colors of your own soul as much as possible during the period between birth and death.Here is a picture you need to remember, for all these reasons, when you find yourself struggling and looking at the walls of the house. If Shawshank Redemption is not inspiring, what is inspiring, I do not know. \n",

      "Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with \"Red\" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, and although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other.

Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money-laundering operation.Although the film was a box office disappointment, it received multiple award nominations (including seven Oscar nominations) and highly positive reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It is now considered to be one of the greatest films of the 1990s. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray. It was included in the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition).In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" \n",

      "Basically, the movie is fantastic. The story is very good and the ending is really meaningful. So are the dialogues and the acting. The story flows slowly. That might be a setback. I really liked the way the prisoners led their lives. The scene on the roof, where they all enjoy was the best. Its totally worth our time. I will advice everybody to watch it. We can learn a lot from it. \"Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\" This dialogue really struck me. The death of a certain character was really sad. I also loved the trick used on the warden. At some point, I think the police officer should have been punished more severely for his brutal actions. \n",

      "the main strong point of this film is a good backbone that created by multi layer, complex and unpredictable screenplay, and the dream of success inside all of us, especially in the bad times that everybody think, things goes not well, it is the story of life, and prove for us that every single second is valuable and must be seen carefully, with a plan toward future. it learn how politics works, and the chess playing of the life. and being ready for different scenarios of life. the playing of actor are good, and also overall atmosphere of film. camera, and flying shots for 1994, were really good, and state of the art. music and sound effects were really compatible with the moments of film, the other strong points of this film was the curve of info that screen play gave to viewer, it was trigger curve! as till end you can't predict any thing, you can create your own ending, happy or sad, (normally sad), but suddenly every things will change. this is really good, when you do a empathy with main character and then you will see that he finally winning the game. \n",

      "Best slow movie.You want to end but can't just to know what will happen in last. Once you started to see your interest would be created.Actually this movie is for specific person who don't get bored if there is no action or romance or hi-fi stuff. This movie contains a lot of time in talking to each other.In this movie direction is good and story-line is best but it took time to develop base.Once your interest is created you'll never pause the movie. I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison. \n",

      "The story is utter nonsense while the acting is pretty good. I have watched this film many times and enjoyed it but fail to understand how it is the top rated film here on IMDb. The Warden plays his part to perfection and would never have allowed Andy to outwit his decades long tenure which in itself is simply ridiculous. The entire Parole board must have been bribed to keep RED ANDY & others inside so were in on the game as were those who organized work outside the prison walls. This review is critical and may not put smiles on easy to please faces but tough. there are many other much better films with fault free story lines. \n",

      "Before I review this fascinating tale of abuse, intrigue and resourcefulness taking place in a penitentiary, let me state the following... \"Bad things happen to good people.\" The movie starts with a court trial for the murder of a banker's wife. Our defendant is Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) accused of this crime and all the evidence or lack of points in his direction. Found guilty Andy and other recruits (little fishes ) are bused over to Shawshank Prison. During the ride, a portly (FAT ASS)Frank Medrano starts to whine about the fact that he's not suppose to be here.The rookie cons are greeted by the Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) who chillingly affirms at the end of his speech, \"Welcome to Shawshank.\" Fat Ass continues to moan about being in jail but Captain Hadley (Clansy Brown) wanted to hear no part of his whining.Meanwhile the prison inmates where placing bets on which rookie con will crack under the strain of a first night in prison. As the neophytes walked down the main corridor to a loud bunch of inmate hecklers as they yelled endlessly,\"Here fishy fishy.\" Veteran Con Ellis Redding AKA Red our narrator played by Morgan Freeman bet two packs of smokes on Andy Dufresne. Meanwhile the majority bet on Fat Ass to crack under the taunting and teasing of the hardened inmates. The mocking was too much for poor, hysterical Fat Ass as he screamed for his Mommy as Captain Hadley beat him endlessly with his night stick as he laid lifeless on the cement floor. Prison life was presented in all it's harsh realities right from the start. The next morning Red was amazed that Andy made it through the first night without making a sound. As the movie progressed Andy needs a rock hammer to make Chess pieces. Red being the prison hustler/scrounger can get mostly anything from the outside, magazines, liquor and posters. Red and Andy develop a friendship/bond. One day the Warden offered volunteer work for the inmates to tar the roof of the guard house. The names where picked at random and Andy and Red were among the chosen for the task. The first day as the men were dipping there mops into tar buckets under the hot sun, Andy overhears Captain Hadley complaining of an cash inheritance. The other guard congratulates him on his new found cash but Hadley says the government will tax him on every penny of it. Andy takes a u-turn toward Hadley and Says, \"Do you trust your Wife?\" Hadley enraged, grabs Andy and is ready to throw him off the roof. Andy in breathless desperation replies, There's a way to gift your spouse tax free and I'll can show you how to file the papers and it's perfectly legal for a small price of three beers for each man working on the roof. A few days later it came to pass as his fellow inmate looked on at Andy as they were swigging suds on a hot roof. The Cons at least for a little while felt like men thanks to Andy and his legal advise. Andy had won the respect of his peers. Despite doing curry-favor for the guards, with W2 forms and retirement advise Andy wasn't protected either. Being constantly harassed and beaten by Boggs and his pose (The Sisters). Boggs wanted Andy for sexual favors and I'd like to tell you Andy put up a good fight but the truth is Andy ended up in the hospital infirmary while Boggs laid in the hole of solitary confinement for a month. Word got out about Andy's nemesis to Hadley and the guards and they didn't want their personal Banker harmed any more. Boggs was beaten to a pulp and the Sisters never laid a hand on Andy again.The movie continues and shows the hopelessness of an innocent educated man adjusting to an institution. Making friends and gaining respect with his knowledge in a world of maladjusted criminals. Building a library and fudging the books under the direction of the Warden. This shows how a person entering the criminal system become institutionalized on a positive side and a negative side. Veteran actor James Whitmore give an impressive performance as Brooks the original weathered Librarian. Also notable was the performance by Tommy (Gil Bellows) who takes this story in a different direction. The appeal of this movie is how everything ties together in a hopeless situation and comes out clean on the other side. The original book (Stephen King), was at best, ho-humm by critics standards but the magic of the screenplay brought this story to new heights. Kudos to the screen writing of Frank Darabont. Never get tired of this movie. \n",

      "I wanted to rate this a 10 but seriously I rated Good-fellas a 9. So I am not even sure why people rated this so high. I mean 9 is about right but at 9.3 that would mean a bunch of people gave it a 10. Seriously we are talking about the godfather and plenty of other great movies. Gladiator and so on. And its a 5 star movies (as I would like to say basing it off the hotel rankings). but 10, OK.Normally I click the spoiler alert on her just because right over it says black list and frankly when I hear the phrase \"blacklisted\" i think of Al Capone, so no thanks on that part. Which leads us right into the character Andy. He was accused of killing his wife and her lover. Plus the scene was set in the late 40's. Perfect time to set a script. I love the classic cars. You don't get people saying \"that would never happen\" most people weren't even alive then. Along as they aren't talking on their cell phone in the movie, then most of the time people just watch. Andy gets falsely accused mostly to his cold demeanor in the court room. Its 2017 and I watch Snapped, forensic files and I was a avid court TV watcher before they changed, and if you go to court in the fashion he did with a judge deciding your fate (i didn't see the jury read the verdict on that one maybe i missed that part) you are definitely not going to get any sympathy from the court. Which in his case and now you need all the sympathy you can get. He does all the taxes and even money laundering for the warden when he eventually plots and escapes prison only to get that money out of an account and then go on to live life on a beach. Why let another person steal your credit for hard work when you can get credit for your own work. I wouldn't suggest breaking out of prison to do it (that would be a felony) but high stakes high rewards, right?Also with Andy's character. He made you feel different and you wanted to watch him. He was not predictable. When turned up that music in the wardens office I was like \"wow that took some guts to do.\" And also about the guys who kept torturing him and raping him, that made you feel different about things. This was a person who was struggling. And you wanted to see how it ended. What makes this film great is its dark and it brings you into the movie. Books have a lot more time and lot of ways to get you into the book with words than movies can do with video. Words lead to imagination and simply can give you a very vivid image. Video is what you see and what you get. Hard to duplicate a book so the best you can do is be dark about about describe people the best you can do in a 2 hour time block. Sounds easy but its not. When you watch this movie you feel like you are in prison. They don't waste time talking about the food in prison. We got it, I am sure the food isn't exactly like a restaurant in the Hampton. They spent most of their time explaining Andy.This is another story about a person who didn't fit in with what society has labeled him and he told people the truth and they didn't believe him. So he figured another way to bring the people who held him captive while fixing his own life. It didn't happen over night. He didn't just take what life gave him, he took what life gave him and used it against them and kept a memory of it and wrote everything down. My favorite part is when Tim ribbons is talking to Morgan freeman saying \" i had to come prison to learn to be a criminal.\". I got chills from hearing that. Cause that is the truth. A smart banker mixed with criminals is very dangerous. They know all the laws, the loop holes and they have the patience and confidence to do it. I wouldn't rank this movie higher than the godfather like a lot of people have it on here. But its ranked as a 5 star movie to movie. Which puts it in the category of the godfather, casino, Good-fellas, Brave-heart, and the Gladiator. Then again this film is unique, the prison guards beat the lights out of people after the light are out. \n",

      "Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne Bob Gunton as Warden Norton William Sadler as Heywood James Whitmore as Librarian Written and directed by Frank Darabont Based on a novel by Stephen King Crime, DramaRated R142 minutes| Roger Ebert September 23, 1994 | Print Page\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a \"prison drama\" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word \"redemption\" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. \n",

Everything in this movie from the way it is shot to the story makes this a must see for every so called \"Movie Fan\".The story about Andy Dufresne that is sent to prison for lifetime for a crime he maybe didn't even commit. And this movie shows how he handles his time in prison, and how he helped his inmates with getting better facilities by giving time and effort to get the funds needed. And don't even get me started on the ending, the ending takes the movie to a whole other level by showing us how he has been planning his escape from the start and the emotional pay of when Andy and Ellis meets in the final scene.All in all this is the best movie i've ever seen and probably the best i will ever see \n",

      "At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the \"only\" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words \"His judgment cometh and that right soon.\" The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.\" Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the \"sisters,\" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the \"redemption\" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb. Don't miss it. \n",

      "The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made.

      "The first time I viewed Shawshank Redemption I didn't find it to be anything special. Sure, stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were good BUT their performances weren't anything special...or so I thought at the time. Frank Darabont directs Shawshank Redemption with a gentle, guiding hand allowing the actors to discover the essence within their characters. Some actors, undoubtedly, would not be up to the task. Robbins and Freeman, however, are not \"some actors.\" They are consummate actors and masterful in their portrayals here. Based upon Stephen King's novella, Darabont creates a film that never buys into the drama of its story, instead choosing to present the lives of the characters involved without histrionics. I have long felt, in fact, that the film may even improve upon the novella by bringing it into focus and providing it with a pacing that allows a more explicit character development. I have noticed that many of my favorite films are ensemble pieces, and while Robbins and Freeman shine here it is actually the entire cast that brings this story to life with such grace and beauty. Supporting performances by the likes of James Whitmore, William Sadler, Gil Bellows and others who take what could be caricatures and give them in-depth personalities and thoughts and feelings. Thomas Newman's score is supremely divine and changes along with the characters. It further enhances Darabont's pacing, as well. There are so many memorable scenes in Shawshank Redemption, however, the closing scene is certainly among one of the best closing scenes ever witnessed. It is hard to fathom that a \"prison\" movie could be a source of tremendous hope, light and inspiration. Yet, to call Shawshank Redemption a prison movie is to minimize its greatness. It is a brilliant film, a study of humanity in all its wonder AND it happens to take place within the confines of a prison. Moving, brilliant, inspirational, hopeful and empowering are all words that describe \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" With outstanding performances from its ensemble cast and a work of tremendous cinematic poetry by director Frank Darabont. \"Shawshank Redemption\" creates a stellar vision that teaches, challenges, inspires and evokes a wide array of emotions and thoughts that serves to remind us that in the darkest moments of our lives there is always a light that shines within. \n",

And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.

James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film.

For all that we have seen swarming around the top of the biggest movies ever filmed. I was half past two stuck to the chair of cinema without even blinking hours, savoring every minute and begging to be longer, because I realized that I was watching a virgin and that this was a masterpiece. Staff face out of the room I can not forget: the satisfaction of the idiot. Silly happy face. Happy to have been part of something big, and silly because you can not yet comment on anything until this very nice feeling to go away.But the biggest thing is the last half hour. When I was asking God knows who, who Shawshank lasted longer, I gave that to me is the best outcome of the history of cinema, for the duration of your footage, for as tying each of the ends and being splendidly filmed. Half an hour we were fascinated, again, to the thousand people who would fill the then-and defunct was the largest room in Donosti. Word of mouth was the most resounding success of The Shawshank Redemption. \"Hey, you have to go see that movie, it's amazing ...\" or something like that, I guess.Based on a story by Stephen King, Darabont adapted a masterful script that was his debut. This film, say the gossip, impressed especially teens and twenties for having one of the best stories of friendship between men. Accustomed to see tough guys who crashed five, forced here to look with new eyes the protagonists and its history, just hallucinated. Personally, I think it is the most beautiful ever told about the friendship between two men history. Morgan Freeman, as we did in Million Dollar Baby, is the main character who narrates throughout the film the adventures of his friend, in the end you realize that you knew nothing.I think Morgan Freeman plays the role of his life here, not Driving Miss Daisy or Million Dollar Baby. The same Tim Robbins, his absent expressiveness think that came in handy Dufresne's character. Side, all luxury: the perfect warden, orderlies ditto captain, James Whitmore -the unforgettable older-, game of prisoners who accompanies our friends as much. All perfect. A great address with them. I think nobody doubt it.In short, a masterpiece like the crown of a pine. A film that, while not teach you anything new, makes you love cinema like few others. A photograph beautiful, excellent assembly and a colossal adaptation. Requeterequeterecomendable.MASTERPIECE\"The funny thing is that when I entered prison, I was a good and honest man, and here, I have become a thief.\" \n",

      "Parents need to know that The Shawshank Redemption is an Oscar-nominated 1994 movie based on a Stephen King story about a man sent to a maximum security prison in Maine in the 1950s who shows the other inmates perseverance and provides a sense of hope and optimism in the bleakest of places and under the most difficult of circumstances. The gritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a corrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Prison rape, while not graphically shown, is very strongly implied, with references and body positions suggesting forced anal and oral sex. Guards beat and kill an inmate. A prisoner is shot and killed by a man with a rifle. There is also a scene in which a character crawls through 500 yards of a sewer pipe filled with excrement. There is also frequent profanity, including \"f--k\" and its variations. However, the film also shows inmates forming a loving community of friendship and support despite oppressive conditions and a sense of maintaining perseverance and hope in the darkest of hours. \n",

      "Shawshank Redemption: Shawshank Redemption is a classic movie that is well written and beautifully produced. With a lot of suspense and action it is a movie that everybody should watch. Tim Robbins an actor that has been in many movies such as Nothing To Lose, Bob Roberts, Arlington Road, and many more, plays an important role in the movie Shawshank Redemption. Andy Dufresne, who is played by Tim Robbins is a banker that is convicted of killing his wife and another man that she was with. While in jail he meets a guy named Red who is played by Morgan Freeman. Red is known as the ¨guys who can get things,¨ from cigarettes to rock picks he can get it all. Andy keeps a low profile in jail for the first few years. He then becomes friends with a group of guys in the jail that includes Red, but also makes some enemies. With a lot of fighting scenes it helps show the real life events of what jail would be like. On the other hand, the director does a good job in making Andy a very interesting character from his personality and actions. He is very sneaky and persistent, but is also determined and fearless in some situations. The one thing that might turn away a younger audience is the language. The Director does a fantastic job with setting the story and letting it play out but also uses a lot of language that would be used in jail. He shows how lonely, how different ,how depressing, and how life changing jail can be. Throughout the movie the audience takes away a lot of lessons that is shown through the actors lives and stories. One iconic line that I loved was from Morgan Freeman, when he was talking to Andy after he got out if the ¨hole,¨ when he said ¨Get busy living or get busy dying.¨ Frank, the director of this movie directed over 10 movies such as, The Green Mile, and The Majestic. He has been nominated for 3 academy awards and one golden globe award. He has worked with many famous and well known actors such as Morgan Freeman and Tom Hanks. The movie has won many awards including, best picture, best actor in a leading role, best film editing, and many more. The movie is a well written and well produced movie that had a lot of twist and turns that grabs the audience attention and keeps them watching and wanting to re watch the movie. The plot was well put together and flowed throughout the movie which was shown in many different occasions. I believe that this movie is one of the best movies that I have ever seen and is one of the best movies that you will see too. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption: Accepting the bleak and harsh realities that present themselves in our lives is part of what it means to mature as a person. No film I have ever seen so deeply encapsulates this sentiment as Frank Darabont's Shawshank Redemption. Two convicted felons live out their life sentences in the Shawshank prison, usually by outfoxing guards with red's smuggling network or just rambling with old chums. The Shawshank Redemption is a masterfully crafted film because the excellent cinematography, engaging plot, and Tim Robbin's acting eloquently reflects the frustrations of a wrongly convicted man named Andy Dufresne, and his struggle to maintain one of the most valuable aspects of humanity: hope.The outstanding cinematography and drab grey shading help convey a bleak setting at the beginning of the film. Tense moments were punctuated with dark shadows cast over the actor's faces, and intensified further with Morgan Freeman's dulcet narration. The establishing shots of the prison were dull and grey, akin to the monotonous lifestyles of the institutionalized convicts that had accepted their lot in life. The somber tone created by dull colors and shading slowly captivated my attention, leaving me with baited breath in anticipation for the events to unfold.The majority of the story was set in Shawshank prison, where our main characters, 'Red', and Andy Dufresne stare the reality of a life sentence in the face. Throughout the film, the two main characters complement one another with their incongruent views of what being behind bars truly means. Red believed that they should accept their current situation and make the best of it, whereas Andy tried to busy himself with his hobbies: keeping his mind focused on things beyond the walls that caged him. I found this optimistic behavior incredibly inspiring as a viewer. There is truly a positive gem of wisdom to be found in a person who is thrusted into an impossible situation, and still finds a perseverance to escape it as Andy Dufresne did.The actors in this film performed extremely well overall, and Morgan Freeman's narration enriched my experience of this film immensely, because it complemented Tim Robin's delivery of Andy's character. Tim Robin's acting during Andy Dufresne's first interaction with Red was so well done, I felt as though Morgan Freedman's narration was manifesting on screen rather than being acted out. The entire cast succeeded especially well in bringing their respective characters to life: not forcefully exuding emotion, but casually, and crisply conveying memorable character interactions.The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful piece which stands in a class of its own: original, nuanced, and engaging. A great deal of care, time, and consideration was placed into the production of this film. I reflect back on the many other films have emerged in recent decades: films that tried to emulate Shawshank Redemption's sleek mature essence, to no avail. Truly this film stands without peer by my metric. I have enjoyed the viewing and critiquing process of this film immensely, it is truly a treasure which I would recommend anyone watch for their enjoyment as well. \n",

Acting perfect, storyline perfect, soundtrack perfect, emotional drama perfect, everything about this movie is perfect.When this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to. But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and it's popularity grew. Eventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As the years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history.I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion. The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.

      "It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (\"looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over\"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. \"I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,\" he tells Red. \"Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'.\" \n",

It is told through the eyes of fellow convict Red, played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman has an excellent voice for narrating. Andy Dufresne is wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to prison. While in prison he helps others to give his life purpose. The theme is about dealing with life no matter what comes your way. Andy deals with being lock up by helping his fellow inmates. Andy coping summed up best with the character Tommy. Andy helps Tommy pass the high school equivalency test. Helping others aids Andy in passing the time. Another example of this can is when Brooks, played by James Whitmore tries to cope with life outside prison. He does not learn how to deal outside the jail and commits suicide. Red says it's institutionalized; that after so long you know of no other way to live. Every man has his breaking point. Andy found his and escaped.

There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.

The film is based on Stephen King's novel: Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption. It's a story of 2 prisoners : Red and Andy's prison life and how both men lives are bonded for 20 years in the prison. Frank Darabont's outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's Novel. His direction and script is one of the best in film history. Morgan Freeman perfectly acted out one of the most recognisable character in film history: Red. In the film, his voice matches perfectly the tone and rhythm of the lines he was suppose to say. Although, some will say Freeman should have won the academy award in 1994 for Shawshank Redemption, I personally still feel Tom Hanks should win the award (like he already did) because although both actors' narration was extremely good, Hank's acting was better than Freeman. In conclusion, I feel Shawshank Redemption should remain it's status as one of the best drama films ever made and should be remembered forever. 10/10 \n",

There is no doubt that the Shawshank Redemption is the best in its own era, as a 1994 American drama film, and it marks the career top of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. As it is adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, the banker who was sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover. It tells the story of who claims of his innocence works his way out from scratch by a non-innocent way. During his time at the prison, he made friend with a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, and got himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in the money-laundering operation. Surprisingly enough, the film was a box office disappointment, despite the fact that it received multiple award nominations (including seven Oscar nominations) and highly positive reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism.

It all comes down to one simple choice \" get busy living or get busy dying\". The key word here is \"busy\". When Andy finally breaks free, you don't see him at the end sipping vodka on the beach; he is working polishing an old boat and restoring a hotel in the \"hope\" of running a successful business.... Finding peace and happiness after overcoming an injustice needs you to set goals and work to achieve them. Happiness is found in the journey, on the way, not in the goal itself.

      "This is without a doubt still my absolute favourite film, ever. It's a film that I can always be in the mood to watch, whether I'm feeling high or low due to the unbelievably victorious ending. The entire film is beautifully shot, with no need for any special effects and it does so well based solely on the story itself, the phenomenal acting from Tim Robbins, as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Red.The basis of the plot, for those who haven't seen it (where have you been hiding?!) is Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is accused of double homicide of his wife and her lover and sent to Shawshank prison for two life-sentences in the 1940's. Shawshank prison is full of corruption and when evidence that can prove Andy's innocence is discovered, even this can't help him escape the walls, so he must find an alternative.My personal favourite scene is when Andy finally escapes the prison, after digging through his cell wall with a rock hammer, crawling through 500 feet of sewage pipes and coming out the other end with the wardens forged accounts. Andy stands at the end of the sewage pipe with his arms raised looking up to the sky, finally feeling free.Andy is also my favourite character in the film, and Tim Robbins earned his place as one of my favourite actors after this role. Andy is known to be a quiet, calm man - wrongfully accused and locked up, trying to get through day-to-day of his sentence. Tim Robbins never raises his voice above a whisper, is softly spoken and this lends itself to your feelings and sympathy for Andy from almost the very start of the film. His relationship with Red is a thing of beauty, showing two men from different backgrounds - one actually guilty of murder - becoming close friends with mutual respect for each other.There is no part of this story that isn't incredible, the film doesn't drag for one moment and you genuinely want more when the credits roll up.The film is based on the novella by Stephen King 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'. \n",

      "I've watched this movies just because it's the highest rated movie of all time. Also everyone I know who's had watched this movie prior to me was going like, \"Greatest crime movie ever\". Honestly I don't think it deserves that title. There are lot many and way better movies than this one. But talking about this one in particular, great screenplay, good character building, more than sufficient suspense, and a good old \"Happy Ending\". Great one time watch. The concept of taking few pieces of concrete every day out of the wall and throwing out in the open seems a bit absurd to me, I mean that process would take ages to dig a hole through wall and then out of the prison through ground and that to big enough for a man to pass comfortably. \n",

      "If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. The film received multiple award nominations (including seven Oscar nominations) and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. Some of \"The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil.Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word. \n",

The ending is sort of predictable if you think about it enough but ties up the story nicely. Morgan Freeman plays the character Red very well (like Morgan Freeman does) and is the narrator too since the film is narrated by Red. It shows what prison is like very well.

      "The movie sets an example of the impact the world of cinemas can induce on us. In the current scenario where the movie makers, directors, all look to lure the general public with science fictions and other high stuffs, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION takes a rest. It creates its story around traditional background of common characteristics like hope, belief, self-esteem, transformation and most important redemption. The movie is set on location of prison, that is quite a thinking, say innovation in this field as well. The best thing about the movie is the fact that unlike many movies which focuses on hero, this movie focuses on the surroundings. In that way it binds us to the surrounding and helps us to live as a part of movie with respect to common persons. We find ourselves in unison with the feelings of sorrow, hope grief, etc. While maintaining the poetic and moving dialogue, Darabont also proves that a film can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience with its dialogues only. Tim Robbins makes Andy a man of few words, quietly spoken. He doesn't get real worked up. He does not volunteer himself, reach out to us or overplay his feelings. It is often better to wonder what a character is thinking than to know. Coming to credits away from acting part, Roger Deakens have done a beautiful work as far as cinematography is concerned. The positions of camera and the awe struck beauty of prison shown in starting scene is just mind blowing. Thomas Newman's music enhances rather than informs, and there is a subtle touch in the way deep bass rumblings during the early murder are reprised when a young prisoner recalls another man's description of the crime. Darabont wrote the film to observe the story, while a little focus on punching it up or upstaging it. The actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. The movie is really a not one timer. You can taste its flavor again and again. The movie will tend to bind you in its surrounding many times and in years to come. \n",

      "The story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a \"prison drama\" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word \"redemption\" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. \n",

      "There are standard ways to stage a prison film and standard ways to tell a story by Stephen King. But \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" based on a King novella and set in the correctional institution of the title, succeeds in avoiding the familiar.Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank Darabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care.There are times when \"The Shawshank Redemption\" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those \"triumph of the human spirit\" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cell block. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two.When Andy is convicted of his wife's murder, the judge pronounces him \"a particularly remorseless and icy man.\" He sustains that chill when he first arrives at Shawshank, remaining aloof from other inmates even when those inmates threaten him with physical harm. \"I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight,\" says Red, who knows Andy has been gang-raped by fellow prisoners, in one of the film's only halfway-brutal episodes. \"I wish I could tell you that, but prison is no fairy-tale world.\"By : JANET MASLIN The New York Times Published: September 23, 1994 \n",

      "It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shaw shank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shaw shank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (\"looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over\"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison. \n",

Eventually the pay off comes when Andy finally receives his small tool for rock carving and we eventually find out he's been using this tiny hammer, the size of a pinky finger, to ever so patently dig himself out of prison.

      "Yhe Shawshank Redemption has earned a reputation for being one of the most popular films of all time. Despite an unimpressive performance in the cinema box-office, it regularly tops 'most popular movies' votes. Tim Robbins said of the film: 'Why has it endured? ... The reason why it's had a profound impact on people has a lot to do, I think, with its spirit, and the hope within it. The idea that over a long period of time, someone's ambitions can come true, that resilience and persistence pay off.This movie is about a man who discovers himself after he is sentenced to life in prison.Andy plays the role of the innocent man, who is doing time for a crime he did not commit. Andy Dufresne is a banker before he was convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Andy is shipped to Shawshank Maximum Security Prison to spend the time of his life.Andy slowly becomes friends with Red, an experienced lifer and his gang. Shortly Andy also becomes popular with the prison guards also the vicious Captain Hadley offered him protection against the jail's not so friendly convicts in exchange for financial counseling.The warden also takes benefits from Andy's banking knowledge by exchanging privileges for creative bookkeeping. Over twenty years of time in prison Andy is able to maintain his sanity and dignity by his mental force. \n",

      "yes, is most of on great film and helps to show very beauty film That is the case for most of Illumination's projects, so I must start by commending their advertising team. Although this movie was funny, the trailer seemed to showcase most of the jokes and gags seen in the movie. The new jokes that the audience hadn't seen before were more aimed toward the kids, but didn't strike the adults as much as their competing studios (Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks, etc.) usually do. With a pretty straight forward plot and a substantial amount of potty humor, I felt this film was more for the kids than for the family. The character development was very robust for the amount of characters featured in the film. There were some under developed characters, but most of the main characters were top of the line. The sewer sequences were very well lit and the animations flowed together and were very finely detailed. The movie was good and the voice actors were top notch.

Top-notch performances, exceptional cinematography, and masterful direction. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" comes out of nowhere in the sense that it is a first feature film by Frank Darabont, who, with this one work, declares himself a special talent. He adapted King's story for the screen and insisted on directing the story too, much in the same way that Sylvester Stallone could not be pried loose from \"Rocky.\" Guts equals glory. Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. A 21-year friendship between a lifer (Morgan Freeman) and a New England banker convicted of murder (Tim Robbins) is the focus of this gripping 1994 prison drama, capably directed and adapted by Frank Darabont from Stephen King's short novel Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.

The leads are very good, the story is almost believable, and you actually root for the heroes.I think the reason it got such a good reputation and unlimited reruns on TV is that it has a positive message. There is a guy who goes to jail for life and he still finds the energy to search for ways to improve his situation. The crawling through the sewage pipe at the end of the movie is the metaphor for living life with the right mindset, in other words doing all you have to do to regain freedom and dignity. I often compare this movie to Cool Hand Luke, which is very similar, and better in many ways. The message is the same, only there is no happy ending, so Cool Hand Luke gets a lot less screening. \n",

      "The great sleep gamble People who do not get enough sleep run the risk of developing serious health problems including cancer, diabetes and heart disease, experts have today warned. The British public has been accused of becoming 'arrogant' in ignoring the vital importance of getting enough shut-eye each night. Smartphones, social media, tablet computers and watching television in bed, have all been blamed for interrupting the body's production of the sleep inducing hormone melanin.'Metabolic health, in addition to genetic predisposition, is largely dependent on behavioral factors such as dietary habits and physical activity,' experts wrote in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology journal. The study said that addressing some types of sleep disturbance  such as sleep appeal  may have a directly beneficial effect on patients' metabolic health. But a far more common problem is people simply not getting enough sleep, particularly due to the increased use of devices such as tablets and portable gaming devices. The disruption of the body's natural sleeping and waking cycle, often experienced by shift workers and those working at night, has also been found to have a clear effect on metabolic health, as well as an increase in rates of chronic illness and early death.The prevalence of life-threatening health problems, including cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease is increased in those who compromise on their sleep, studies claim. Professor Russell Foster, at the University of Oxford, accused people of being 'arrogant' in turning their back on years of evolution that has seen the human species rely on the sleep cycle. He said: \"We are the supremely arrogant species; we feel we can abandon four billion years of evolution and ignore the fact that we have evolved under a light-dark cycle. What we do as a species, perhaps uniquely, is override the clock. And long-term acting against the clock can lead to serious health problems.\" A person's body clock is, in part, driven by exposure to light and a need to sleep and rest is the product of a time when people were active during the day, resting at night. But modern life has interrupted sleep patterns. A 24-hour society coupled with technology disturbs the natural order, leading people to sleep at irregular times. Experts said smartphones, tablet computers and social media keep people more alert later into the evening. The blue light emitted by the devices has a shorter wavelength than whiter light, acting to inhibit the body's production of melanin - the hormone which induces a need to sleep.Havard University's Professor Charles Czeisler said: \"Light exposure, especially short wavelength bluish light in the evening, will reset our circadian rhythms to a later hour, postponing the release of the sleep-promoting hormone melanin and making it more difficult for us to get up in the morning. It's a big concern that we're being exposed to much more light, sleeping less and, as a consequence, may suffer from many chronic diseases.\" source: Daily Mail Nehézségi saint: középfok \n",

      "this is the best film that has ever been made. No apologies to The Godfather: Great film, but this.... THIS is the culmination of perfect casting, narration, slowly-developing scenes, film score... There's not a single moment in the film that I can point to and claim that it ought to be different.﻿ There are times when \"The Shawshank Redemption\" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those \"triumph of the human spirit\" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cellblock. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two. A MASTERPIECE. \n",

It invites you into a whole new world, into the minds of convicts. It all ties in perfectly with its ending and seeing corruption being overthrown and justice winning. It makes you root for the bad guys for once. Overall it should be on everyone's top ten lists and everyone should watch it. Also, the casting in the movie is phenomenal. Morgan Freeman is perfectly cast for someone who has been in prison for ages, he perfectly fits the role of the old dog. Tim Robbins did not receive enough credit for this film. He seamlessly blends into character from an actor. He is cool under pressure, intelligent, and a little bit scary. This movie is probably going to be superior to almost all other films for many years. It is a timeless classic that almost brings you to tears. \n",

This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted.

      "It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (\"looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over\"), andpredicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. \"I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,\" he tells Red. \n",

      "The film The Shawshank Redemption is about Andy Dufresne, a prestigious banker ordered to serve time in prison for crimes he was found guilty of, however he claims that he has not committed. The film mainly follows Andy and his \"friends' that he has made in prison around their day to day lives. From working in the prison or what is like to be in your cell by yourself at night, it also follows Andy through his plans and is most definitely brilliant and unbelievable escape.Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption is a film about hope and persistence and the rewards for being hopeful and persistent. Throughout this film the main character Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) shows that by being persistent and hopeful you can achieve whatever you want. Red (Morgan Freeman) is a character who plays the devil's advocate throughout the film; while he supports Andy and everything he does, he also manages to make it seem like his actions are pointless and a waste of time, however Andy did what he wanted and did not care what others thought, thus reinforcing the theme of persistence. The film uses Brooks (James Whitmore) actions to exemplify the decisions that are made when someone loses hope and does not have the persistence to move forward. The sound effects of this film are key to the added sense of realism and dimensionality of the film. Such as the background noises like small water droplets to the right up front noises like the slamming and locking of the prison cell doors. Other things such as background music are used to set the theme of the movie and the scene currently being viewed, while the background and foreground noises add depth and dimension to the film immersing the viewer and giving the sense of physically being there. Sounds like those of the prison cells, water droplets and the absolute silence of solitary confinement exemplify the theme because to survive all of that you have to have the determination, persistence and hope in order to move forward and survive. The director, Frank Darabont, used the cutting and duration of scenes in order to reinforce the theme and convey the emotions of the film. Such as when there is a dramatic/sad scene the panning is very slow and the scene last for an extended period of time with soft music playing in the background, thus providing the feeling of hopelessness, loss and sadness. On the other hand he also uses this technique to convey happy scenes in the film, such as when Andy's schemes went to plan, the scenes were very bright, usually with upbeat background music and were brightly lit. All in all this movie was done very well and tells the story while trying to immerse the viewer into the film. The story being that by being persistent and hopeful you can improve your always improve your situation and maybe achieve redemption for the wrongs that you have done. \n",

      "Film Appreciation is a course that many college students will take throughout their educational journey in hopes to pass time in an interesting manner while fulfilling an elective. That is my purpose of this review; to fulfill a requirement. However, choosing this film was very deliberate. Upon seeing the list of films to choose on a weekly basis of the course, I knew I would save the best for last. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Giving special care to camera angles, costume design, lighting, transitions, sound effects, and Morgan Freemans god-like voice the creators have produced a film that will stand the test of time. Fulfilling my first requirement I will introduce our notable characters; Tim Robbins plays the mysterious main character Andy Dufresne, next we have the renowned Morgan Freeman playing Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, and Bob Gunton starring as the Warden. Each character does an outstanding job making you believe you are experiencing a real-life tale. They possess human-like qualities that are relatable for all which aids in the emotional connection the audience is sure to form with this film. Andy has the will and drive that most people can only hope to possess in their lifetime, while Red is down-to-earth but extremely resourceful. The Warden is cruel, blinded by greed and power which most people in his position would likely succumb to regardless of what they think they would do. These three powerful characters are aided by many background characters who offer humor, softness, or harsh reality. The central theme of this film is that hope exists for all, we just need to never give up enduring life along the way. Peculiar theme to standout in a film encompassing the life of prisoners, but regardless it is my personal take away. We primarily follow the flashback of Andy who is serving two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, but along the way there are other characters who receive special focus in order to evoke unavoidable emotions. We see the different sides of Andy throughout his journey, though much of the time he remains stoic as to not give away key plot points to the audience or even the characters within the film. Given the heavy dialogue and emotion there are many ideas to take- away from this film; you will just have to watch it yourself to experience them all. The most important factors of this film are the use of transitions and sound effects. Since the film takes place over a span of many years it is important to allow the audience to experience the passage of time correctly or the illusion is lost. Changing between slow motion and fast paced transitions, the film layers sound perfectly to the changes whether it is off-screen sound or visible sound made by objects on the screen. Some scenes fade away to aid emotional response, while others flash through quickly in order to give the audience of sense of the effect of the entire action going on in the scene. Combining the believable acting, with an emotional yet oddly- relatable theme and brilliantly done editing/sound effects, The Shawshank Redemption is a film that every person should watch at least once in their life-time (though I recommend more than once to really take it all in). It is a genuine work of art which I will gladly watch any day. (Especially gratifying when it can be used to fulfill a college requirement). \n",

      "Keeping this short and sweet, meek Tim Robbins is a convicted accountant who is sent to a real MEAN prison in Maine. The captain of the corrections officers, the massive-jawed Clancy Brown, is quick with his baton, agitato, so to speak. The warden, Bob Gunton, is a corrupt dictator. Morgan Freeman, serving a life sentence, becomes a friend of Robbins. Robbins has a lot in the upper story and goes about doing good for the penitentiary and for the inmates, despite the beatings, attempted rapes, and unjust punishment. Under his management the library becomes a beacon for all prison libraries. Many brutal years pass before Robbins, an amateur geologist, tunnels through the prison wall, hauling a bundle of ill-gotten pelf, crawls into a five-hundred yard long sewer pipe filled with excreta, and splashes through a river to freedom and a tiny coastal village in Mexico, Zijuataneco. I drove there about the time this escape takes place and it really WAS a cheap, peaceful, fishing town with an irregular water supply. Now it's a metropolis. After forty years of imprisonment, Freeman is finally paroled. He joins his friend Robbins in Mexico, where they pursue an honest living as simple fishermen and become lovers for life. (Kidding.) It's a long movie but a gripping one. Movies about prisons are difficult to make. The surroundings are hardly epic, the wardrobe drab, the inmates participate in what the sociologist Erving Goffman called \"the small rewards\" system common to all total institutions -- gifts and trades of items like cigarettes and harmonicas. The inmates have humble jobs, nothing exciting about working in a laundry. No women. Threats and occasional fist fights but no open warfare. And here there's not even the suspense of watching men prepare for an escape. How do you fold these conditions together and come up with a story? The people who produced \"The Shawshank Redemption\" have managed to pull it off, and without directorial display -- no fireworks, no instant cutting, no screechy metallic noise on the sound track, no razzle dazzle whatever, just classic movie making. The success of the film is helped ENORMOUSLY by Morgan Freeman's performance as the friend of Robbins. He's an exceptional actor, and though we may see him now mostly in the role of mentor, his early performances as a heavy shouldn't be ignored. God, he was one charming and terrifying pimp in \"Street Smart.\" Robbins does a good job too, although his role requires him to be subdued. It also requires him to be saintly, alas. There's nothing wrong with him. He's a genius, doing everybody's tax returns. He's more sinned against than sinning. Cool Hand Luke at least was reckless and expedient and brought the storm down upon himself. And Luke's guards would have made mincemeat out of Robbins. Robbins' prison is a kind of fantasy land in which he can at will commandeer an office, lock the doors, and play a record of an opera over all the loudspeakers. It's also a pipe dream to believe that all of the inmates would stop what they're doing and stare in wonder at the loudspeakers broadcasting two ladies singing in Italian. Slim Whitman, maybe. But Joan Sutherland? They would have booed. Nor would inmates show the kind of solidarity on display here, once Robbins pulls them together. The coolest presentation of self in an institution like this is utter indifference, except for some offense against the honor of one's self or one's gang. It's a cold-hearted place in which practically nobody applauds when someone else succeeds.However, put all the fantasy aside and accept it for what it is, a fictional tale of men who pay dearly for misdeeds and ultimately save themselves and undermine the foundation of corrupt society. Not heroically, just by sheer persistence. \n",

      "Perhaps Shawshank didn't take off in popularity until it hit the video market because it is a very intimate and quiet film. The story was too \"personal\" to be viewed in a large theater but best viewed in your pajamas in the privacy of your own home, a place where you could allow yourself to sink completely into the story without being distracted by the nearby sounds of strangers. Stephen King's stories and novels are written with a great deal of inner dialogue and make for difficult adaptation to the screen. This is a beautiful story of struggling in a hopeless and oppresive world, while being unsure of deserving to hope.

Tim Robbins played a very good role but I was more entertained by Morgan Freeman who played a very nice person called Red which was a friendly man where you didn't expect from that he was in prison because of killing someone. The film includes some beautiful scenes, for example the scene where Andy Dufresne arranged some beer for some prisoners. From the moment you met the boss of the prison Warden Norton you hate him and you want him to get sacked. Also one of the leaders from the prisoners played by William Sadler is an asshole. The end of the movie was for me a unexpected one. I thought Dufresne wouldn't make it in prison and that he would take suicide. But he escaped and that scene was terrific. And the most beautiful scene for me was the ending of the film where Red and Dufresne met each other in Zihuatanejo.

      "Best film ! I like so much. Unique !!! But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system. \n",

Stuart from \"Die Hard 2\", was funny as Heywood; Mark Rolston was okay as Boggs; Gil Bellows, who was Tommy who knew the real guy who killed Dufresne's wife and lover and was killed before he could tell anyone else, heck he looked like he did some Elvis Presley impersonating in his time; and let's not forget the legendary James Whitmore, who played Brooksie, enough said there. \n",

He had been convicted for murdering his wife but in reality he hadn't.The movie meticulously shows Andy's life in prison life.

      "One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising \"twist\" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once. \n",

Was unsure as to why it holds the number one spot in IMDb's title, but now all doubts cleared. People lacking HOPE, Motivation, Self Confidence should see this. It portrays in a good manner as to how a person overcomes Fear in regard of Hope. Go for it blindly and you'll never be disappointed. A man who's being framed wrongly for a crime not committed by him goes to jail. Finds some friends, some allies and some woes. But in the end the route of escape, the hope for a better tomorrow, the will for survival of a man continues. And he continues his fight silently for more than 20 years in silence.

We can see the example of Brooks, there even being arrested, he felt free, he was someone there and built his character there, but unfortunately ended up settling in a lifetime caged and to be returned to their free life, I did not know what to do and He ended up committing suicide. Fortunately it was not what happened with Andy, he He insisted so.

It is still valid today as we look at men and women enduring prison and racial injustices involving the treatment of black prisoners. This comes out in Morgan Freeman's performance and the reactions to his parole hearings.Tim Robbin's performance, shows the utter joy and excitement of beating the system in his expressions during the record scene, and the arrival of the library. The writing and dialogue show intelligence behind the conversations of those whom are usually found to be marginalized. The character development of Red and his friends is absolutely astonishing as they play off of and rely on the validity of Tim Robbins pulling off a truly amazing performance. The Bad guy: is always hard to write about. But he did good making us hate him, whatever that may entail, bless him.

      "A story of friendship and endurance set in the reality of prison life, The Shawshank Redemption is best known as an Oscar-nominated film. However, this theatre production is based instead on the original novella written by Stephen King relatively early in his career.The direction in this piece is stylised, with a deliberate slow rhythm and pace, particularly in the first act, greatly reducing any sense of menace that you would expect from this so-called tough prison. It is almost Brechtian in style. This becomes frustrating as it takes much of the emotion out of the production; a vital piece of the human connection that then means the audience is less invested in the outcome of the possibly innocent Andy Dufresne and the lovable rouge Red. This underplaying of emotion results in a restrained and difficult to engage with character in Dufresne, played by Ian Kelsey. There are moments of anguish from Kelsey, but with the direction holding such a tight reign on the characters, the moments are too far and between. Patrick Robinson's Red fares a little better as he addresses the audience with a charming older storytelling voice, but is still not given enough freedom to truly embrace Red's charisma. When using this deliberate stylised direction, the impact on the reality of the stage fighting also showed, again detracting from the idea of brutality.The second half picks up the pace slightly and the play overall is watchable with good performances all round from the cast. However, without the rawness derived from emotional context, the prison life never feels as if it is unbearable to be in or watch, meaning the power of the ending is lessened.By Isabella Fraser \n",

He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle. \n",

Strong story, act is on high level. My favorite actor is Morgan Freeman so you can think how i'm happy that he is the one acting in this movie. If you watch this, you will enjoy every second of it. Pefect movie for family night. I would watch this every day. The plot for this film is very unique, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like this.

      "There are standard ways to stage a prison film and standard ways to tell a story by Stephen King. But \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" based on a King novella and set in the correctional institution of the title, succeeds in avoiding the familiar.Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank Darabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care.There are times when \"The Shawshank Redemption\" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those \"triumph of the human spirit\" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice- over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cell block. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two. \n",

      "I'm not a professional critic, so I will put it the simplest way I can. This movie is one of those movies you keep coming back to every few years and watch again. It will never get old either.The prison represents life itself, the lives we were born to at least, and it tells us another life is possible out there and for that we must be able to break out of the life we are born to. The film shows the birth, maturation and re-birth of a person who does not belong to the society at large. In the final the man is reborn in mud, filthy just like before, but this time he is going to live the life he chose. \n",

      "And I truly mean that. When I first saw this film, I was blown away.With superb acting, superb story, perfect emotion and tone, and an incredible twist ending that still amazes me, this film is completely and utterly perfect. The film speaks of hope, and the film's two main characters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes that, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used because it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes that hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better tomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight. While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be held to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of the greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is merely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly great, but not the masterpiece that it is today. And, watching it repeatedly makes the film even better, because experiencing the events that occur within the story makes the ending even greater. I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over and over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I simply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that makes this film incredible. However, I will not waste any more of your time talking about how wonderful this film is. And please do not waste any of your own time. Find a way to see this movie as ASAP. It will be time well spent, and you will certainly see it multiple more times. \n",

Often in our life we deny to take certain steps which might help us in achieving a goal in some years, but exactly after spending as much time sitting mum, we reflect on the time spent and regret not having taken those steps in all these years.A maternal cousin of mine from Denmark visited us in the summer of 2012 and he mentioned this film in a lot of conversation. Sadly, I wasn't too much into Hollywood films yet. Now that I am since over 15 months I checked the IMDb list of top 250 films and found this on the first place. I was immediately reminded of my cousin and thought that he wasn't after all just randomly naming a film. It was very clever to have shown Andy as innocent. This makes the viewers get more engaged into his suffering in the prison. The scene where he goes to his room with the rope, you almost find yourself saying in heart how this will be great injustice and something very, very sad and depressing.Again, all in all, this film is out of this world. One of the best of all times. \n",

      "A little anal rape and before you know it, you've made a martyr of a man. Good martyr though, except that he stays alive through out the entire movie. Well told in classic Morgan Freeman style but Shawshank redemption, whilst being a very fine example of Cinema, is lacking in much. It is very tense and dramatic but simple in it's premise, innocent man will escape from jail. In between are an abundance of clichées and well used jail house scenarios, as seen in many other lock up romps. The difference with Shawshank is how polished everything is. It's not a surprise when Frank Darabont is behind a helm. He has proved to cast well and have perfect characters execute a story to the most professional of levels. I think that the movie would have been better if they had been following Red and Andy get's busted when Red comes meets him in the sandy finale. Maybe executed by FBI and Red was involved in the sting operation. you may not agree. \n",

Found life thru knowledge for education. Friends and loyalties were made. Hope came and was squashed. That leads to anger and action. Friends worry without knowledge of future of protagonist. Hope is obtained for more than just the protagonist. Great for people whom like; biographies, emotional, male bonding, facing obstacles, seeking hope of the future, prison life, life building skills, justice prevailing, getting even with those whom treat people horribly, creating something good in a bad situation. \n",

He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not.

Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder.

And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film.

      "Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption (1994): Dir: Frank Darbont / Cast: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore, Bob Gunton, William Sadler: Gripping film about finding refuge in a place of despair. Tim Robbins plays banker Andy Dufresne in 1947, convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. The verdict is not the issue, but rather his familiarizing himself into routine life within prison walls. He faces the trials of violent leering inmates but forms a bond with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, played by Morgan Freeman. Redding can get things for a price and soon Andy has items smuggled into his cell. Andy finds favor when his banking comes into play and doing taxes for the corrupt Christian warden and the guards. Andy is able to improve the library but discovers a scheme by the warden that leaves him to his own devices when proof of his innocence is sabotaged. Director Frank Darabont paints the grim and depressing portrait of prison and populates it with personalities struggling to exist within. Robbins is at his best as a victim adapting and improving his circumstance before intelligence wins out. Freeman is great as the humble and resourceful Redding. James Whitmore plays aged librarian Brooks whose release leads to questions regarding freedom verses existence. Bob Gunton is effective as the ruthless warden. Redemption is freedom of mind and soul whether in prison or in opportunity. Score: 10 / 10 \n",

Everyone involved must have perfect \"form\". Director, Darabont, must have been at the top of his game when he put this gem together. Of course the actors were excellent; Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint. The thing that makes this movie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly believable (and bad guys don't come much worse than them).The other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: It must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning, middle and end. So many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects wrong. Not so with Shawshank Redemption.

The way he stays in the same exact character through the whole movie is impressive. He always has a mild composure with little outbursts of anger and rage which I think he uses perfectly. Morgan Freeman as \"Red\" was impressive as always. Taking almost the mentor role for Andy to help him get through being in a jail until finally escapping. \n",

Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself.

Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10 \n",

      "A movie worthy of the label, 'very good'  but being number one out of all movies ever? No way, are you kidding me? One should go back to snacking on those wacky mushrooms  please. Better yet let us all have some, those hallucinations need to be shared by one and all. It was a good movie...very good in fact. And without question, this is some quality entertainment. I really did enjoy the one time I saw it. I have to say though, I did not wet myself with glee when I watched the flick. It just seemed like the plot was far-fetched and a bit tiresome. The premise of good triumphing over evil is outstanding. It is too bad that the action of defining good and evil is clearly sitting outside the reality-room in 'Redemption.' 'Spoiler Alert' 'Spoiler Alert' Prison guards = bad and hardened criminals = bad? Why? I can understand Tim Robbins latching his wagon to this ridiculous notion  but Morgan Freeman? Sorry it just doesn't compute. For me  a very good movie  but not a great movie. I will give this \"King\" drama an 8/10 \n",

      "Andy, who is a young and successful banker, has been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and lover. This movie revolves around the events in his life from when he comes to prison till he escapes from it. This the one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best message conveyed by this movies is of eternal hope. Andy was sent to the prison though he didn't commit the crime. Over the years, he retains hope and earns the respect of fellow prisoners, especially he bond with a longtime convict, Red. Over the time, Andy finds ways to live out life with relative ease as one can in a prison, leaving a message for all that while the body may be locked away in a cell, the spirit can never be truly imprisoned. And finally he escapes from the prison and frees himself. This movies truly depicts the meaning of the quote \"Hope is a good thing maybe the best thing, and no good things ever dies\". \n",

      "When the odds are against you, there's only moving forward or turning back. When Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to one of the toughest prisons for two consecutive life sentences for murders he did not commit, the mere thought is enough to make anyone insane. Prison life is tough, but Shawshank prison gets the cake for displaying just how harsh it can be. Corrupt guards, brash punishments and bare minimum accommodations are only half the picture. Just as soon as he's about to break, he makes a discovery that requires incredibly true determination and hope. The Shawshank Redemption is a screenplay adaptation of Stephen King's novella; Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Writer and Director Frank Darabont was able to capture a realistic representation of what prison life might have looked like in the first half of the 20th century. Although the budget was very modest for this film, it really looks like they didn't need anymore. A cast that consists of veteran actors helps to meld the film's respect with their performances. One very noteworthy performance was from Morgan Freeman's character: Ellis Boyd (Red). He was also the one who narrated most of the film and that's always a treat for the audience.Thomas Newman who was responsible for the soundtrack did a great job enhancing the scenes whether it is eerie or joyous. Although at times I felt that there needed to be a more powerful theme to reflect the scene which fortunately was only in a few scenes. Nevertheless, the captivating themes are something to remember in this film. Memorable characters, a great soundtrack and an excellent plot all make this a highly recommended movie to watch. There really isn't much to nit-pick about this film which is what really brings it to the top. Like all highly rated/regarded films, there tends to be some form of overrating which is understandable, since all great things attract jealousy. \n",

      "The fact this movie stands at the IMDb top for years now should be enough to convince you to watch this asap. Based on a novella by Stephen King, Frank Darabont's film is perhaps the most accomplished prison drama ever. If you liked Papillon, you are going to love Shawshank's Redemption. But this is more than just a bleak prison drama. Not that there aren't grim situations depicted here. Several points in the story are not for the faint of heart for their cruelty and outright sense of injustice. The ordeals of one Andy Dufresne (in an unsurpassed performance by Tim Robbins) and his fellow cell mates are in fact so harrowing that will make you beg for justice to be done and pray for salvation. Is there hope and light at the end of the tunnel? Let's say that this movie belongs to that group of films (like Sixth Sense and Jacob's Ladder) that have a little secret and when the time for catharsis comes, after all the trials our hero has been through, it doesn't just rain, it pours. It is that precise moment that turns what would have otherwise been a finely crafted drama into a timeless classic. As the protagonist at one point says, hope is a good thing, perhaps the best of things. And it is hope that fuels this expertly told tale of fight against adversity and why this film resonates so strongly with so many people. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption.A film about an innocent and hopeful banker named Andy Dufrense, who gets wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover she cheated him with. He befriends a charming yet fearful fellow inmate named Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding. The two men bond for 19 years in Shawshank prison from 1947 to 1966. They work hard, find solace, earn the respect of the other prisoners, and eventually redeem themselves by escaping. All by committing acts of common decency. There's a reason why this movie is number one on the top 250 movies of the IMDb. There is only one word that can describe a film like this. Perfect! This film is perfect in every shape, way, and from. The directing, writing, acting, story, plot, characters, visuals, lighting, atmosphere, pacing, technicals, editing, and even the music is all perfect. It's fully enjoyable from start to finish. Not once did I take my eyes off the screen or stopped listening for a sec. Heck, even the casting and believability in this film is perfect. Each and every actor fits their character perfectly and the film is entirely flawless. There was not one moment in the entire film that I pointed out a plot hole, or a continuity error, or anything. The best part about this film is the impact the story has on the viewer, because this film has the most satisfying and perfect ending ever in film history. It will leave the viewer with the best feeling ever. It's a timeless film that can be watched countless times over again and never gets tiring. It's rather unbelievable that this film didn't win a single Oscar. Luckily, this film doesn't need an Oscar to know that it's the best film ever, it just needs the general public. What's even more unbelievable is that this is the first movie that director Frank Darabont made and it's based off of the Stephen King novella. Now, I never read the book, but I can already bet that this film is even better than the book and that's saying a lot. This film can even go so far as to be therapeutic. If anyone out there is reading this and is feeling depressed, please watch this heavenly film and be uplifted. The moral of this movie is a moral that speaks for all movies that helps a character get through their darkest times and it is a moral that can help anyone in real life get through their darkest times.

Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly assaulted by the \"bull queer\" gang \"the Sisters\" and their leader, Bogs.In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him legally shelter the money. After a vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is sent to another prison and Andy is never attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen.

Frank Darabont truly outdid himself with this masterpiece.Tim Robbins' is truly convincing as Andy Dufresne, in a role that would truly define his career. We see an innocent man thrust into an unfair situation, who maintains hope to keep himself moving and that hope itself will become contagious. Morgan Freeman steels the show as Red, his partner in crime. Freeman brings to this film a sense of thoughtfulness, a sort of diamond in the rough that is prison. He may not be perfect but he is wise, no man could have pulled off this role quite like Freeman did. Too much do we forget Bob Gunton in the role of the sinister Warden Samuel Norton. We are both terrified and disgusted by him as he skirts the law and abuses his inmates in an effort to stay at the very top.The violence and the nature of some of the inmates is worth noting as it portrays prison accurately. In films like Cool Hand Luke we see how these chain gang members are portrayed as sort of good old boys who merely made a mistake. With characters like Boggs Diamond we receive a visceral reminder of what prison life is really like, and we accompany Andy on his ride through it. The plot twist is elaborate and clever, like I would expect from a Steven King novella. It floors you and leaves you at the edge of the seat. In the end, you can not help but feel happy, joyous, and hopeful.This is a must see before you die. An inspirational movie that will leave you spellbound for days.

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a film that plays out the story of Red's, Morgan Freemans, experiences, encounters, and friendships while imprisoned for murder. Red begins with his first encounter of Andy Dufresne, Tim Robbins. Andy was quit peculiar in the way in which he carried himself and his quietness, which intrigued Red. Andy requested a rock hammer from Red, from then on Andy and Red's friendship began to grow. The film shows the hardships prisoners experience, including being jumped and raped by the \"Sisters.\" But the film also displays what good can be done within the prison, such as Andy, an experience banker, volunteering to do taxes and give financial advice to the guards in return for a better life behind bars for him and his friends. Andy uses his privilege to rejuvenate the prison's library and offering assistance to prisoners to obtain there high school equivalency. The film is spanned out over 40 years, showing the long term sentences these men have served. There are several themes as work in this film, but the most prominent one is the power of hope. Throughout the movie, glimmers of hope are expressed by the men but then soon shattered. The beginning scene of the bet of which \"New fish\" would cry was soon realized to be cruel and led to a prisoner's death. Throughout the movie, Red (Freeman) had lost all hope. Red displayed this loss of hope with his uncaring attitude displayed at his parole hearings. He had no motivation to express to the board that he was a changed man and was ready to return back to society. He said the same speech at almost every hearing which lead to his denial until he later regained hope for a brighter future and spoke of his regret to the parole board. Hope was also displayed through music, the singing French woman and the harmonica. A glimmer of hope was displayed for Red when his friend escaped prison, this hope grew when he was unexpectedly granted parole. Through Red's narrative, it seemed as his Red's fate was to be the same as Brooks, \"Institutionalized,\" but Red prevailed and pursued his long lost friend, Andy. The letter that Andy left for Red under the lava glass near the oak tree stated, \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\" This changed Red, he now understood the saying \"Either get busy living, or get busy dying,\" and he chose life. Symbols used throughout the film were rocks and pinup posters of iconic women. Rocks were used ultimately to hide the true purpose of the rock hammer, but they were also a symbol of hope and normalcy. The posters of the iconic women, such as Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe, were posters to cover up Andy's true desire which was to escape this unjust imprisonment and return to his normal life. An example of good sound effects is the scenes leading up to Brooks' demise. The sound effects create a sense of understanding and realism; soft music is played as her narrates his final letter to his friends back at prison. Shots of the hustle and bustle of the city, cars whizzing by and honking at Brooks, the noisy and bossy grocery manager. In the final scene of him committing suicide, the noise of his pocket knife is very prominent and creak of the chair as he mounts it to carve his name in the rafter, and the sound of the chair being kicked away and the tension on the rope is heard. This is very realistic and somber. The music is soft which created an emotion of sadness and does not drown out the important subtle noises. A movie that shares some of the same themes and motifs is Green fried Tomatoes, this film portrays a significant amount of time and displays the power of hope as well. In conclusion, this film displays the power of hope and how it effects people when hope is lost. Andy's unwavering hope brings \"light\" to others around him, possibly saving their lives. \n",

      "As far as I am concerned, I think it is a movie well worth watching. I am a senior high school student in China, and I really do not have lot of time to lead a free life as most of students abroad (stated in many books and stories in China). As is known to many people, there exists a strict examination (The National College Entrance Exam) in China, and each student only have one chance to attend it during his/her lifetime, so nobody will give it up and everyone is fighting for it.Just like Andy, Red and many other people in the Shawshank. Maybe most of us living creatures do not have a real freedom.It is a jailbreak story in many people's eyes, but it isn't just like that in my aspect. I regard it as a kind of redemption as the title of the movie. As is stated in Oxford Dictionary, \"REDEMPTION\" is \"the action of saving or being saved from sin, error, or evil\" or \"a thing that saves someone from error or evil\". In my opinion, both of its meaning was highlighted.I do not want to talk about this movie from performance, even if it is the soul of a movie. But I think there must be a more important thing.Red is a man lost his heart, even if he is always speaking ill of the guard, his eyes is like a silent street, he can bear anything, and he will not have a quarrel, he sentenced himself to death. Though he said he had been totally changed in the jail, nobody would like to APPROVE him of get out of it. But when he tell them his true words inside his heart, he was soon set free. It is just like a kind of joking, but I think it is of high applause. I don't know how to express it in an exact word in English, it means \"血性\" in Chinese.As for Andy, the other main character in this movie. He is an energetic bird looking forward to freedom, which is wise enough as well. Carving the wall, behind which is freedom. It takes him nineteen years. But it is fair. In his past life, though he was freer than that in Shawshank, he was also trapped. Trapped by his daily routines, by his wife's abandon or by those business and title he earned. For many of us, one should work until his sixties or older, and when he could enjoy his life, there is not very much left exactly. Andy used nineteen years to gain a freedom, and he got it faster than we.Maybe the western cannot get my idea, but in fact, a people in China even need to work in his seventies. There are thousands of rooms left empty, but most of people cannot have their own house in his whole life. That is the reason why I am longing for freedom.Owing to the blessing of the god, I have my own house with my family, we have cars. What's more, we do not have trouble in earning a living. Maybe I could say I am a born First-Class, but too many of us cannot be like that.WE NEED REDEMPTION.I have to say it is the Top-10 Movie I have ever watched. And it even can be the best TWO out of all, the other one is Leon. \n",

      "So the shawshank redemption is a 1994 prison movie staring Tim Robbins as former banker turned double murderer Andy Dufrense. When Andy's wife and her lover are found murdered at a country club Andy is blamed and sentenced to two back to back life sentences in the notorious Shawshank State penitentiary ran by a sadistic head guard named Byrom Hadley as well as the corrupt warden Samuel Norton. When Andy decides he wants a rock hammer to carry on his hobby of shaping rocks he meets Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Reading described as \"a man who knows how to get things\" Red is also \"the only guilty man in Shawshank\" as all other inmates claim they are innocent. Andy and Red quickly become friends as Andy repeatedly tries to convince all the other inmates that remembering there are places outside of Shawshank and they should not accept they may never leave the prison. Andy then takes a young high school dropout named Tommy under his wing to help him get his high school qualifications it is this boy that brings forth the revelation of Andy's innocents after telling the story of about a old cell mate who claims to have committed an identical crime which he got away with. After Andy's young friend is shot dead by Hadley Andy asks an inmate to get him a 6ft long piece of rope. the next morning Andy does not show for roll call and Red fears he has committed suicide however the do not find Andy hanging in his cell like Red expected they do not find him at all the night before a plan that took 19 years to get ready took place and Andy had escaped Shawshank prison.

      "I admit it, not being a fan of prison movies and being puzzled by the strange title, at first glance this film wasn't very appealing to me, but it ranks #1 on IMDb and that made me curious. I also admit that at first I was disappointed, the beginning seemed like another Hollywood cliché: man falsely convicted for murder, and it all looked like yet another fight-for-your-proper-rights movie. But after the first half hour I started realising that this is not a prison movie, neither is it a movie about hope or friendship. The background story is irrelevant for the main point of the film and could be exchanged with any other story where someone finds himself in a place of desperation. What is the true beauty of this movie is that it comprises the wisdom of thousands of years of human history, starting with the philosophical school of the ancient Greek and Roman Stoics and Cynisists and leading to the modern work of psychologists like Viktor Frankl. The film even plainly states the message in one scene, where Andy says that the one thing they cant take away from you is the freedom of thought and the freedom to chose your attitude. The first night in prison, Andy does not utter a syllable, although everybody expects him to break down as the apparent wimp he seems to be. Andy truly lives Stoic principles, never loosing it, always ahead of everybody's games. Because he is focused, not trying to change the things he cannot change, like the sadism of the wards or the fact that he most probably never will get parole, but step by step changing the things he can, while being observant of the little tweaks and holes he can exploit to his own advantage. At the end of the movie you realise that he had a plan from day one, and with endurance and focus managed to pull through. Also he never lets go of his guiding principles, which makes him incredibly strong in such a harsh environment. Andy does not simply hope to get released one day, he does everything in his power to regain freedom, and through this attitude creates a leverage so strong that he is even able to crush his enemies in the end. At the end also Red gets it, instead of trying to manipulate the committee into giving him parole by telling them what he thinks they want to hear, he speaks of the only thing he had the power to change, his attitude towards life, and promptly gets released. The topic alone would be sufficient to propel this movie into the top ten of the best films ever made, but it is further enhanced through a captivating story and narrative, wonderful photography, and a superb acting performance of practically every actor involved. Morgan Freeman sticks out for me, because I admittedly have a weak spot for him, but that does not diminish the contribution of the rest of the cast. I guess it will always remain debatable which movie is \"the best\", I think one should not taint the extraordinary contribution of this movie to film history with such petty discussions. Without the slightest doubt this is one of - if not the - best movie(s) I've ever seen. \n",

      "Why do so many people love this film? We see a story that offers us all hope. There is hope, real hope, all of us can have. As a Christian, I see many reflections of the Gospel in this film. It is interesting to me, how so many love the film, yet reject Christianity and the message it brings. Again, it's simply interesting. It may say more about the Church than about those who love the movie. A question I always ask myself, who has the greater redemption in the film, Andy or Red? On the surface, many can see it as Andy. After all, he is wrongly convicted. He goes to prison. He escapes. He has his ultimate redemption. One can easily view the film in this light. However, I believe Red has the greater redemption. Here is why. Andy is goes to prison without committing the crime. Andy has a physical redemption. Yet, it is Andy who always has hope, always has a plan, and always brings light. To his inmates, to the world he inhabits. Red is guilty. His crime, his sin, has pervaded into his life. He has lost hope of what might be. His life is prison. He cannot escape, even as he gets out into the \"real world.\" He is still not redeemed, spiritually in his soul. Andy's journey through the dark tunnel is a foreshadowing of the darker journey Red is walking. And we don't know if Red will survive. Yet Red has a redeemer. It is Andy. Andy never gives up on Red, even after he has escaped. He does everything he can to keep connecting, communicating, and reaching Red, to say to him - this is not the end, there is hope. You only have to take a step. You have to get busy living. Red does. He finds hope. He is truly redeemed. As a Christian, I see great connections between this film and the Gospel. I see in this story large elements of the Greatest Story. We have a Redeemer. He was without sin, He was not guilty, yet He came to us, in a world filled with sin, darkness, and death. He came to our Shawshank. He came to set the captives free. In this world, He healed, He taught, He educated, He cared for, He encouraged, He worked miracles. In this world, He continued to be wrongly accused, persecuted, beaten, mocked, and sentenced to death itself. He entered into the dark hole. He traversed through the darkest tunnel we can imagine. He rose again. Yet this was not the end. It was the beginning. The beginning of His work to continue reaching out to us, communicating to us, doing everything He could to say there is hope. He wrote us a letter in His Word, the Bible. He gave us the means to take the journey, a bus in essence, by His Church. He promised He would be there. And He is. He is waiting for us. He give hope and a home. Now and forever. Red's redemption can be a portrait of our greater redemption. We can say, like Red, \"I find I'm so excited that I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel. A free man at a start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain.\" We can be free, truly. We can have hope, fully. Now in the world. Forever, in the world to come. \"Get busy living.\" Well said, Red. \n",

      "So, I first would like to say that this was a very good movie. While watching it I realized I was watching the highest rated movie in IMDb. It definitely deserved that rank. I was hooked right from the beginning. I will put an disclaimer for anybody who wants to see it that it being a rated R movie there is vulgar language, violence and showing of alcoholic beverages. Also there is a scene where there might be nudity but from what I can remember I think the most you'll see is some guys butts. The main plot of this movie is about a banker, Andy, who goes to prison because he is accused of killing his wife. He meets a guy named Red and they become best friends. This movie had the right amount of everything without having too much of something. It had comedy, drama, action. When watching this movie it made me think. One of the things I thought about is that life can change on the outside world when you're locked up for so long in an enclosed space. You also can feel so out of place that you'd rather go back to your enclosed space because that's all that you know and feel comfortable with. The movie explains that if you have hope then the outside world isn't too bad. This is a movie that I would recommend any adult to see. Even if you think you might not like this movie or it's not your cup of tea I believe you'll still enjoy it by the time you finish watching the film. \n",

      "This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come. \n",

      "There are thousands of written reviews for this film on this website and the majority of them positive. I know I am just adding to this long list of positive reviews, but I feel this film deserves to be my first review on this website. While this film may not be my favourite film, it is most definitely a film I respect. When I was young and watching 'The Goonies' and 'Back to the Future' I thought films were only made to entertain and were not made to convey a clear message about humanity. This film was the first film I watched that made me understand that the film medium could provide the world with such philosophical messages and could teach young people, like me, that life must be valued. Pretty deep right? Well this is the message that the film carries. Red values Andy's friendship and life. He does not want him to die and wants him to survive and when I was watching this film I thought... wow! Two prisoners, one who definitely killed another person, can be so rational and kind. I learnt from this film that the world is a horrible place and emotions can get the better of people; but through it all, it is about moving on and making sure that one is not affected by the emotional trauma that has arrived at their front door and instead take that trauma and improve themselves and other people like Andy did throughout the film. By the end, when Red and Andy are embracing on the beach, free, I see two men who have been through years of pain and self-pity clear of all negative thoughts; I see two friends that through all the emotional trauma that we see them going through are still strong.Now I can talk about themes and the impact that this film had on me all day long, but I have to praise everyone involved in this film. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman embody their characters perfectly and when I watch it now as a 17 year old who has seen his fair share of great performances these stick out as real people and not simply a performance. Frank Darababont, who not only directed the film but also wrote it, crafts a film that is very entertaining to watch but that also conveys these themes effortlessly and writes some very memorable lines that really affect one's perspective on human nature. The scene with Brooks is a scene that had me close to tears and that showed me the impact of being 'institutionalized'.Anyway, I have said enough about this film. It is very good and really pushed me into seeing films in a different light. If you want to read any more reviews or my list on my favourite films of all time please check me out.

      "Parents need to know that this movie is rated R for a reason: The gritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a corrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Two characters have sex (their clothes are on, and it's not graphic), one lovable character hangs himself, guards shoot an inmate and frame it as an escape attempt, inmates attempt and, we are told, succeed in raping Andy, and guards beat and kill an inmate in the opening scenes. But the film also shows inmates forming a loving community of friendship and support despite oppressive conditions.-Common Sense Media \n",

      "Firstly I love this film. It's a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue.The Shawshank Redemption is a perfectly woven, superbly performed, and flawlessly shot cinematic masterpiece that is sure to never be forgotten. Along with Darabont's other prison outing, The Green Mile, he has crafted a pair of subtly affecting dramas with real heart. Shawshank, however takes the prize. Phenomenal stuff. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (\"looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over\"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. \"I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,\" he tells Red. \"Get busy living' or get busy dying'.\"The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles? \n",

      "Best movie I've ever seen. I keep this movie on auto-play. Great casting. Tim Robbins portrayal of Andy Dufresne, an innocent man in prison, who has to break the law while in prison, to live a free life as a fugitive on the run, outside of prison. James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlin, gave a wonderful performance as a man who spent his whole life as a caged bird, once given his wings, he has forgotten how to fly free. Instead of living in a cage again, he opted for a pine box. A solitary man, in a solitary cage, for all eternity. Knowing that the character of Ellis \"Red\" Redding, in the book, is supposed to be a middle-aged Irish man, Frank Darabont's casting of Morgan Freeman solidified this character and brought to life the authoritative demeanor that only Morgan Freeman could pull off. There were many other actors who were considered for the role of \"Red\" but Morgan Freeman pulled off a commanding performance.Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, was a great casting coup. Seeing him play an innocent man who is forced to conspire with the prison warden, in order to be free of the resident prison bullies, commit money laundering, in order to plan the perfect jailbreak and live life outside of prison as a free man, with a new identity that is \"the 3rd cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.\"Clancy Brown as Capt. Byron Hadley, the sadistic jail warden, who gets off on beating prisoners who don't do what he says. Great character actor. William Sadler & Bob Gunton are another great character actors. Bob delivers a great role as a \"holier than thou,\" bible-thumping Christian with greed & corruption on the brain. In the end, Karma serves her justice in the form of a .38 to the head. the movie is full of suspense and has you rooting for the \"innocent\" guy at the end. Worth watching over and over again. \n",

      "Most often when we see a prison film, we think of Oz with a bunch of ruthless convicts, shower rape, and cartons of cigarettes. Shawshank gives a much different perspective. While it has subtle notes of the norm, there is much more emphasis on how one does and passes time, hard time, in a penile system wrought with conflicts. We have a true innocent--a well-read and good-hearted man, Andy Dufresne, caught up in a prepubescent justice system, void of forensic evidence and ballistic reports, teeming with graft and greed on the behalf of the \"God- fearing\" warden. In this world, the guards are more murderous than the inmates, friends stick together more than families, and becoming conditioned to the system gives parolees nightmares about their impending freedom. This story is akin to The Count of Monte Cristo and Alexandre Dumas even gets a brief shout-out in a library scene. For more reason than I can state in this brief review this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and one of a seldom group to which I have given a perfect rating. It is worth the two hours of screening time and you will find yourself rooting for Andy and Red to the very end. \n",

      "This movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goofball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967. Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form. The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle. If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word. \n",

      "simple approach to art can be a virtue when chaos reigns in the world. Just like the neo-folk music that serves as its soundtrack while providing an emotional salve for its characters, \"Song One\" initially serves as a lilting if sometimes downbeat respite from the cacophony that often passes as cinema today.But even a stripped-down emo-ode to the healing power of music needs to build up to a satisfying crescendo. In her feature debut, writer/director Kate Barker-Froyland tends to tiptoe away from the dramatic high notes that audiences often crave and comes up a stanza or two short from a fulfilling resolution.Often, \"Song One\" feels like the timid B-side of last summer's more satisfying music-biz saga, the much less woe-is-me and a lot more let's-have-some-fun \"Begin Again.\" Unlike many low-budget indie titles, however, the novice filmmaker does have the benefit of a couple of actual stars in her cast. They go far to help carry this story about how a young woman reconnects with her family in New York after a car accident leaves her estranged brother (\"Boardwalk Empire's\" Ben Rosenfield), a Brooklyn-based busker, in a coma.As Franny, a rather sullen globe-trotting anthropologist working on her doctorate, Anne Hathawaylooking like the early Liza Minnelli with her gamine hairdoisn't quite as distraught as she was while winning her 2012 supporting Oscar as miserable prostitute Fantine in \"Les Miserables\" or as a weepy astronaut in last year's \"Interstellar.\" Still, her big-screen crying jag continues apace as she and her mother (Mary Steenburgen, who does what she can as a self-absorbed intellectual whose props include American Spirit cigarettes and a twee accordion) take turns sitting vigil in the hospital while hoping for a miracle. Remember when Hathaway charmed us as a quick-witted gangly Everygirl in \"The Princess Diaries\" and \"The Devil Wears Prada\" that could make us laugh? Where has she gone? Back to the plot. Lacking a sanctuary while back homeher mother has symbolically given her bed away to her mail personFranny stays in Henry's room and, like the anthropologist she is, steeps herself in what he has been up to while pursuing his music dreams. Besides recordings, there is a journal stuffed with scribblings: lyrics, deep thoughts, photosand, lo and behold, a ticket to an upcoming concert by his favorite balladeer, James Forester.If you get an inkling that Franny and hipster-poet James will get involved romantically after she tells him about Henry's situation and his admiration for him, that would be a bingo. Johnny Flynn, the English actor-musician who plays James, duly possesses the soulful eyes and shy presence of a folk artist. And he certainly sings and performs well enough, both on guitar and violin. It is not hard to believe that countless giggly girls in their summer frocks would line up after the show to see him.He is also kind enough to stop by to see Henry the next day. Alas, his character is soon revealed to have all the personality of a very sincere though slightly damp sponge. It also is a little too convenient that he has been dumped by his girlfriend, which has blocked his talent for composing new material. Guess who will be his next muse? Bingo again.What time Franny doesn't spend with James in clubs is devoted to appealing to Henry's senses with familiar sounds and smells in the hopes it will stir him. She records street noises for him to hear. She buys takeout pancakes from his favorite all-night diner and pours syrup on them in front of his nose. Franny even shells out money for an antique gramophone to replace one that Henry broke and spins some scratchy records on it in his hospital room. Will her efforts pay off? Will we be able to tolerate her and James' somewhat ill-advised relationship long enough to find out? One wonders what Hathaway saw in this only partially-baked story. It turns out Barker-Froyland was an assistant to \"Prada\" director David Frankel, and it is nice to know that the actress is supporting her climb up the Hollywood ladder.But for those hoping that Ms. \"Les Miz\" will sing again for her supper, given the subject matter of \"Song One,\" you will have to settle for Hathaway's intentionally amateurish crooning of America's soporific '70s chestnut \"I Need You.\" At least she knew better than to revive \"A Horse With No Name.\" \n",

      "So the story is about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a man who has been falsely sentenced to prison. In prison, he meets Ellis Boyd \"Red\" (Morgan Freeman), to help him understand many things about life within the four walls. The newcomer seems different than most of the rest though, and, especially in the beginning, attempts to give his co- prisoners moments to live for, moments forgotten for most of them through simple and imaginative ways. As time goes by, he comes to terms with what has happened and (no matter how he tries to help and evolve), he understands what he is supposed to do for the rest of his life. But there is one thing he won't let go: Hope.I will agree with those who have an issue with the fact that this movie is considered to be \"the best of all time\". I think it's really not THAT good. Although I understand it may has a reason and it's on purpose, the pace is slow (could be characterized \"too slow\") and the music (pretty important for this class of a movie) is \"eh..\" And last complaint: Gil Belows as \"Tommy\" was so annoying...Having said that, there is no one who can deny that it's a beautiful story and greatly told. It's pretty simple really. And it's that simplicity of the story that makes it great... The film takes place in a prison and while most of the people who are going to see it have never been in prison (obviously), Frank Darabont makes you connect with every single character in the film. And he does it so elegantly, you won't even understand it happened. It says more about hope and life with lost purpose than any other film I have recently seen. And when I say \"recently\", I mean films that have been out there the last 20 years. The performances in the movie are extraordinary. Morgan Freeman is great and I guess, even if most people don't really like him, Tim Robbins plays a role he fits exactly into. Bob Gunton is the perfect Warden to portray the necessary villain. I didn't really like William Sadler as Haywood but hey... that's the point, \"not to like him\", right? What I really liked most is the way this movie found time to cover all those issues without losing it's focus. It's great how you are not distracted at all when several things take place, while they are not contributing to the full-story. And yet... you care. Because it's something more than just a case or a chase... It's about life. And you can never get bored in this movie if you're watching to learn something. That's why the people who choose this movie to be moved and capture something emotionally greater and more ambitious than huge gunfights and cop-stories, will be fully pleased. People who choose this expecting for the bomb to blow up and some guys yelling \"Get Down!\" and swearing... sorry, this is not for you. \n",

The visual effects are standard, but that is just fine. It doesn't make a difference either way. The plot is such that it makes you wonder whether or not he should be in the prison, as his attitude to everything seems unlike a murdering criminal. Tim Robbins proves his innocence well in the role, as well as his intelligence, spirit and also the fact that he can hide a hole in the wall for nearly 20 years. Red, played by Morgan Freeman, gives excellent narration and acts well, and is the start of the 'Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman' trend. The rest of the acting cast is so believable you could've thought that it was made in the 1950s.

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 epic American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.This is very good film. I like red in this movie he was a very good supporting actor. this is my favourite movie. the best scene is when he plays the music into the Mick. Another reason why this movie is good in all the actors give an amazing performance. Spoilers he escapes. An amazing film. The role for Andy Dufresne was first offered to Tom Hanks and Kevin Costner, but they couldn't play the role because of issues with the dates. Later, Kevin Costner strongly regretted his decision on turning down the character of Andy Dufresne. Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp, Charlie Sheen and Nicolas Cage were considered for the part of Andy Dufresne, which finally went to Tim Robbins. For the role for Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Paul Newman and Robert Redford were considered, because in Stephen King's book, Red was an Irishman. It was meant to be played by a white actor in the first place, but director Frank Darabont wanted to cast Morgan Freeman as Red.Frank Darabont wanted his favorite character actor James Whitmore to act in the film, so he asked him to do the role for Brooks. The role for the character Tommy Williams played by Gil Bellows was first going to Brad Pitt. Though this character had a small part, it was an important role in the film.[8]I have seen is movie 17 times. The movie cant be better. If you have not watched this movie then what are you waiting for.I end with a quote \"he dispersed like a fart in the wind.\" \n",

      "Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James . also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". \n",

      "Let me get this straight, when I first watched this film I loved it. However when I first watched this film, I was thirteen, and agreed with everything I read. I thought the film was too long, with too much fat, and solemn fat at that. I thought Tim Robbins does a good job, and plays the role how he ought to, but the role still doesn't set my world alight. I'm not a Morgan Freeman fan, that's just me personally. I thought this was one of his more believable roles, before he became a parody of himself. The worst thing about this film is the script, and I feel it thrives in moments of silence. I enjoyed the playing of the record, I thought Brooks hanging himself was excellently done, I thought the rape scene was nasty but not too gruelling. These scenes were well judged, because this film could have so easily fallen into torrid and depressing territory, and it does do that a little bit. I felt the iconic moments of wisdom, are really not so clever. To me they sound like quotes written on a page, and scattered throughout.Overall I think it is a very good film. This is me really reviewing with reference how the average person views the film. What I'm trying to say is that this is not close to best film of all time material. It does nothing groundbreaking or exceptional in terms of filming, or storytelling, or performance or anything. If you watch the film as a whole it's pretty good but not fantastic, if you look at it in bits, some bits are fantastic, others are pretty poor. There's no way I can look at this film an even compare it to Citizen Kane, or Psycho, or Birth of a Nation. It is not on that level of film making.Eight out of Ten. \n",

This film is so popular because the pipe symbolizes your working life and the beach scene at the end is the escape from working life. Its not about prison, its about the 9 to 5.Everyone wants to do an Andy Dufresne.Also, he'd escaped his marriage and gets to live out his life having fun on the beach playing around a boat with his pal and that is presented as the definition of Paradise, maybe it is, but you know it'd probably get old after a couple of days. \n",

Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning it's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV.

However, only Andy knows he didn't commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), experiences brutality of prison life, adapts, helps the warden, etc., all in 19 years.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made.

He is a young banker who has a high opportunity in his job, then his life is turning into the dark, he has to move into a jail just because the court judged that he killed his wife and adulterer while he did not do anything. This point shows me about gap in the law and how the justice court becomes unfair, it's like a reflection of the reality and i do like it. However, the story is told by Red, Morgan Freeman, a close friend of Andy while he was in a prison, it broadcasts every single things in prison, such like right, equality, freedom, and corruption. That's why the movie can persuade the audiences to believe that Andy was really wrong. The story is telling very silently, but the unexpected situation is coming up continuously.It does not make me surprise when I heard that Shawshank got many awards, even many people said that Forrest Gump is better than it and got the rewards more. In my opinion, I think it is because Shawshank is hard for understanding sometimes and the audiences did not get it. It's like this movie is telling by the third party and it was just a new style of a movie at that time. Deeply, It is amazing for me because I cannot guess what is the truth, what is not. \n",

The shawshank redemption showed how world is cruel and cannot be forecasted, by using limited area and place with specific characters. It is quite old film but, still can be explained this era. I tried to watch this film as 2 kinds of views. First, I saw the shawshank jail represent as the human society. In limited place, people really want to make their own 'laws and rules' for them. Sometimes, it looks like nonsense nor illogical but, we;I mean human did actually and.. In this society, there is invisible hierarchy also. Secondly, This film showed how people are survive with their own way in society. Some people do not understand the change, and also some other people are against the laws and rules, such as Andy. Especially, Brooks who kill himself showed the people who do not accept the change their environment. I can see myself, which kind of people am I? This film tells us many things, not only these. When time after time, it will be showed different way, so sure. \n",

      "Shawshank is a good example of how adaptation works - or more specifically, how changes made to the original story in translation often benefit the finished product. The best example of this is the character of Red, who in the original novel is a red-headed Irishman. This is referred to jokingly by Morgan Freeman in one of his first conversations with Tim Robbins; when Andy asks why people call him Red, Red responds: \"Maybe it's because I'm Irish.\".On top of Freeman's obvious ability, the casting decision makes sense because it adds an extra layer of meaning to the character. Red is one of the few black characters we come across; while he applies himself in different ways, he is as much of an outsider as Andy DuFresne. This is borne out by his remarks about institutionalization, which are laughed off by his fellow inmates. Red may be well-connected when it comes to smuggling things in, but otherwise he is just as lonely as Andy.Shawshank approaches the theme of institutionalization with great grace and dexterity. Because the story takes place over three decades, the temptation would be to canter through the plot points and cut straight to Andy's escape - you could even stage the entire story in flashback. Instead, Darabont allows the film to unfold at a gentle, gradual pace, reflecting the mind-set of the characters. They don't realize how trapped they are until it's too late, just as we don't realize that two-and-a-half hours has passed until the credits have begun to roll.The characters reflect the different extents and effects of institutionalization. Brooks has built his entire identity around his books and role in the prison; he is so afraid of this being taken away that he attempts to kill William Sadler's character so he can stay inside. Red is aware of how trapped he is, and shares Brooks' fears, being unsure that he could get things for Andy on the outside. But at the same time, he refuses to let himself be vulnerable, trying to play the system and constantly getting turned down for parole. Andy allows himself to be vulnerable and endures all the pain that it brings him, sustained by the knowledge of his innocence and the hope that he will escape.Shawshank is perhaps the most powerful depiction of hope in all of cinema. The original short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, was subtitled 'Hope Springs Eternal'. The film returns to hope and the celebration of the human spirit like a leitmotif, and succeeds because it retains Andy's humanity in all its many shades. While he is very different to the other prisoners, he is never presented as a saint or goody-goody, smiling gormless in the face of maddening torment. This makes his endurance all the more powerful: we recognize our faults in his moments of weakness, and aspire to his inner moral strength.The film has attracted many Christian interpretations - in fact, in my review of John Carpenter's The Thing, I called it \"a poster child for Christianity\". It's not hard to see why, considering its celebration of inner strength and devotion, and its overall arc of good triumph over evil against the greatest odds. While Andy has been called a Christ figure, he's just as close to the character of Daniel in the Old Testament: he finds himself in a strange land against his will, and in order to survive he applies his natural talents to the service of his temporal masters. Through his labors the people around him benefit and the system is eventually changed for the better - albeit through pain, suffering and several deaths.An equally intriguing interpretation comes from Mark Kermode, who authored a BFI Modern Classic on the film in 2003. In a video discussing cinematic depictions of Richard Nixon, Kermode made the argument that Warden Norton (played brilliantly by Bob Gunton) is an allegory for Nixon, with Andy's prison term matching Nixon's political career. Norton begins reaching out for friendship (Nixon seeking to be elected), then becomes the corrupt leader (beginning in the year that Kennedy was shot), and finally descends into paranoia and disgrace, culminating in a more literal suicide than Nixon offered us.Whether you believe these interpretations or not, Shawshank is a terrific piece of dramatic film-making which soars on the strengths of its main performers. Tim Robbins perfectly captures Andy's distant, ethereal quality while retaining his wry and infectious sense of humor. Morgan Freeman's performance may well be responsible for his subsequent type-casting, but he matches Robbins beat for beat, offsetting hope with world-weariness and guilt. There's also great support from two actors who would subsequently work with Darabont again - William Sadler (who appears in The Green Mile) and James Whitmore (The Majestic).The Shawshank Redemption may not be entirely worthy of its number one ranking on IMDb, but it remains a really terrific piece of drama let down only by its final scene. In every other aspect it's a masterpiece, as a character piece, a treatise on hope and a beautifully paced and mounted Stephen King adaptation. It remains a must-see for all film fans of penchant or persuasion, earning its status as a modern classic and securing a warm place in our hearts. \n",

      "This work from 1994 directed and written by a Hungarian-American Frank Darabont that was based on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption was nominated for several highly appreciated awards, including The Academy Awards and The Golden Globe Awards. In spite of being nominated for so many prestigious prizes, it did not win any. However, this fact cannot put a shadow over the fantastic job that was done while making the movie. Critics from all over the world were absolutely amazed by the drama with outstanding and unbelievably realistic scenery. It is simply a must to pay a great respect to the main protagonists  experienced Morgan Freeman as Red, a man who will provide you with everything you need, and irreplaceable Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker who was unjustly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.The story starts in the late 1940's when a banker Andy Dufresne is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Penitentiary for murdering his wife and her lover. He instantly becomes a friend with a contraband smuggler and the film's narrator Ellis \"Red\" Redding who procures a rock hammer for Andy so he can create small stone chess pieces. Soon, Andy unleashes his financial skills when he overhears the merciless guard chief Hadley complaining about taxes. Thanks to his former occupation, Andy is given a position in the library so he can manage financial matters for Shawshank. As the years pass, Norton, the head of the prison, uses the library and public works worked by prison labor to undercut skilled labor costs so he can receive huge kickbacks. Andy is used for laundering the money using the alias \"Randall Stephens\". In the mid-1960's young Tommy Williams, an irredeemable burglar, is imprisoned. He gets close with Andy and Red and when hearing the details of Andy's case begins to talk about his former inmate. He explains that the inmate told him how he had killed two people and got away with it which seems to be a proof of Andy's innocence. Unfortunately, as soon as Norton hears a word about it, he has young Tommy shot by Hadley. This appears to be enough for Andy. He tells Red about his secret dream of living in a Mexican coastal village and instructs him how to get there when he is free. The next day, Andy's cell is found empty. Norton and the guards find out that Andy escaped through a tunnel which he had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. While they are searching for him, Andy, as Randall Stephens, visits a large number of banks to withdraw the laundered money. Besides that, he sends a package with evidence of what has happened at the prison to a regional newspaper. Will the police and the newspaper trust Andy? Will he and Red ever meet again? Go and watch the bravura ending.It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. The Shawshank Redemption is an opportunity to witness how fate is the best judge in the end, how a frightened cat can turn into a brave lion and how a friendship can be developed even in the darkest moments of ones' lives. Next, I was really impressed by the perfect narrating skills of Mr. Freeman. The actor's storytelling keeps you deeply settled in your seat and you are able to literally breathe the story. I haven't seen such a well-thought-out plot like this in a long time. The diligent work of the producers, cameramen, costume designers, make-up and hair stylists and all of the crew will be remembered. I can't write this without mentioning the set. I have already talked about it, but I need to praise it a little bit more. It was so easy to get into the plot thanks to the set  you do not get a chance to doubt the realism of the scenery. Another aspect to be spotlighted is the soundtrack. Magnificent Thomas Newman and his team produced a piece of quality material which does not stay unnoticed and bonds you even more with the whole drama. Last but not least, I must applaud the directing and screen writing of Mr. Darabont who created a completely unique and new experience for TV viewers and cinema audiences. We can only guess what happens in the end until we finally get to see the finish line of Shawshank. I guarantee you will end up with a wide smile on your face.To sum up, we can only thank the entire crew for the spectacular project with an inspiring story of not giving up. The conclusion of my review is as brief as it can be  go and book your place in front of the big screen! You will not regret it. The massive number of emotions you can experience while watching The Shawshank Redemption will make you laugh or cry whenever you want. \n",

Firstly, I thought Anny was tried to survive in the prison day by day. Red he was a leader of the prisoner. At first I thought he would have a conflict with Anny because He imported things from outside the prison to sold in prison to make a profit for himself. Anny always asked for different thing from other prisoners with him. But truly he had a coolest plan for getting out of prison. The story was complicated but story was telling smoothie because he had plan to escape from the prison. He made the warden trust him by working for him. The warden used him to did his dirty work even he had destroyed the last evidence that Anny wasn't guilt. Finally, Anny payback by a very cleaver plan. So, If you are the fan of prison brake movie. You must watch. \n",

      "The movie is amazing.First let me begin with the theme of the movie. The theme and the concept of the movie is quit predictable because before watching i know that it is a movie about a main character try to break out the the prison and i am quit sure that at the end the main character will succeed and it is definitely like what i thought. but what make this movie great are what is in the movie. All the detail that are given and toward the running of the story line that make it is unpredictable for me of what going to happen next even though i already know that he will break out of the prison successfully.The setting of the movie is not much special because most of the time it is in the prison so not much to talk about, but it is still great that we as a viewer got the see how a real prison look like a how does it really feel as we follow the main character throughout the whole movie.The lighting of the movie is pretty dark and giving a sad and hopeless feeling to us viewer so it is great that we get to feel what the characters feel too.This movie gave me a point of view of a people who is in a prison for to long and don't have a clue of what they will do if they ever got a chance to come out again or not. This movie contain many emotion feeling of the character and really done well on delivering it to us viewing.The casting of the movie is amazing all the character and the actor really look believable like they are who they are.After watched the movie, it gave me so many thing to think about and how hard and how corrupt the world is today, even though the world we live on now is on the different era but there will always be a bad man, and it will never change. We just need to do what is right and continue doing it. \n",

It has it moment, and the greatest flaw of this movie in my opinion is pacing. The Shawshank Redemption may be a tad slow, but it is justified. I believe director Frank Darabont wanted to show Andy's time at Shawshank by showing how slow prison time really is. Some movies are just slow; this movie does it for a deeper reason, adding to Shawshank's genius.Adding to the slow pacing, Andy acting is neutral is bare shows emotion. Which is charming in a way, because Straight face can magically immerse you in a weird way. Neo from the Matrix series for instance. Tim Robbins did this on purpose. Andy was quiet, mellow, and was obviously quite shocked and angry he was going to prison for a crime he didn't do. I feel like the fact that he acted like this just added to the realistic atmosphere of the movie.In one word, a masterpiece Have come at the wrong time. Nevertheless, still an unforgettable movie. The story will take in. Great movie with fantastic performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins..This kind of movie will get you off the hook at first, But it's an acquired taste that you will receive half way through. \n",

Almost all people who watched The Shawshank Redemption said this movie is good, and considered as the best movie all the time, so I watched it.The story is about a man who named Andy Dufresne, a banker is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in the state of Maine. He befriends contraband smuggler Ellis \"Red\" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Spend over 20 years of his life in Shawshank prison and finally he was able to escape from Shawshank prison.I think this movie is interesting enough that always on top in movie ranking. I like this kind of drama movie and it is tear jerking story. Personally I do not like the movie has too much violence, shouting, or yelling. In the beginning I was bored and do not want to continue to watch because there was a scene that Hadley and other prison guards punch and kick until a new prisoner die. Also there are so many scenes that similar to this scene. Those things are what I do not like. Over all, I like this movie. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a movie involving story about life in prison that represents through crimes, bribery, sexual harassment, and drama. This movie was simple but it delivers meaningful messages in all characters' performance especially in the scene when their eyes contact. This film contains emotional impact about true friendship and hope. Brief the plot: Andy, a successful banker, was accused of murdering his wife and her affair. He was sentenced to Shawshank Prison for that. Later in prison, Andy helped one of the prison guards to evade taxes. In return, the prison guard gave Andy and Red, his best friend in Prison, some cold beer. From this cause, Andy became a popular guy in the prison and made a lot of friends. After several years of slowly piercing through the wall using some kind of art equipment, Andy finally broke out of prison. A couple of years later, Red was released out of Shawshank Prison. He came to meet Andy at the beach that Andy told him to meet up when he get released. The highlight of this movie is when Andy used his specialty in evading taxes to make the wardens trust him. The biggest surprise for me is when Andy asked the warden for rope, most of the people who watch will predict that he will commit suicide but the truth is, he used to it tight things up and escape from the prison. In conclusion, the acting in this movie is very good, the storytelling is amazing, exciting and brilliant, and production is quite simply. This movie is very amazing because it teaches me that people must always have hope to move on in their life. \n",

There have been many adaptations of King's works but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" outshines them all. Why? Because it is nothing short of outstanding. I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over and over again, and love it more each time I watch it.

      "Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialog of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialog does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialog. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much- needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget. \n",

This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. \n",

      "I am 22; And I was craving a well plotted movie the other day. And quite frankly I was quite bored of fantasy movies. I wanted to watch something that had to do with the system. I decided to go through the list of top movies of all times, according to IMDb. The Shawshank Redemption was ranked number one based on popularity. I watched the trailer and I immediately fell in love with the fact that it was narrated by Morgan Freeman and that it was about the prison system in the previous century. The movie The Shawshank Redemption Is about a character named Andy Dufresne, an introverted,young,successful banker. In 1947, one fine morning, Andy finds himself guilty of a crime that he repeated says he didn't commit. However, the evidence says otherwise. They charge him for murdering his wife and her lover. Double life sentence. He soon finds himself in one of the harshest prison in the country. There he meets Red and his friends. Andy takes his time but slowly, tactically, befriends them. Andy's wide range of skills helps him get on good terms with the prison guards, and even the Prison Warden. The Warden soon finds Andy so useful that he starts making Andy help him with his bank statements, allowing him to launder money without any suspicion.Soon Tommy Williams enters the picture, and what he discloses changes everything. The movie was very well directed. However, I wish the story focused a little more on how Andy manages to create a false identity. Overall, the movie was very interesting. I loved how they portrayed all the inmates and their problems. I very much appreciated the fact that they didn't show the prison rapes in details, and left most of it to the imagination. Andy's unreadable characteristics were very well played by the actor Tim Robbins. Throughout the whole time, I simply couldn't figure out whether he was really innocent or not, until Tommy Williams enters the picture. Andy's and Red's friendship develops very realistically. The little jokes they share were very amusing, especially the first time they talk, when Andy asks Red why his name is Red. The villainous Warden's character was very unpredictable. His \"Strict Christian\" image was brilliant. It made it seem that he might have a little bit of goodness inside, but as the story unveils, he turns out to be pure evil. The movie overall was intriguing. It does show some real issues that inmates go through- discrimination, sexual frustration, institutionalization and all forms of abuse. I think the movie is very eye opening. I think the message it wants to send out is that one should get to know the system and how it works so that when the system turns abusive, one can do something about it. \n",

      "The Shawshank redemption is an excellent movie that was executed perfectly. Based off of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the movie did an exceptional job of recreating the story. The Shawshank Redemption is a top class movie that needs to be seen by anyone and everyone with the perfect features to make it stand out in the crowd of movies.The acting in the movie The Shawshank Redemption is one of the main reasons that the movie turned out to be so wonderful. Combining the skills of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman proved to be a pair for the ages. With two characters, one quiet, reserved character and one popular, outspoken character, both played by actors with similar personalities. Appreciation was shown for the acting in this movie when Morgan Freeman was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Academy Awards 1995). Although he lost, it is still impressive considering he lost to Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump/ These two actors were not the only actors vital to the production of this movie. Each individual side character was played by an actor perfect for the part. No actor could have done justice to any of the characters like the actors who starred in the film did.The story of the movie was possibly one of the best told stories of all time. Although it is a recent story when compared with stories from all time, it does the perfect job of immersing you in the lives and feelings of the characters and of keeping you hooked on what happens next the whole time. Stephen King started off by writing this masterpiece of a story in his novella and Frank Darabont worked with this masterpiece and wrote and directed one of the top one hundred movies of all time (AFI Top 100). The story is told over a just longer than two hour movie, that does not go on too long or too short. After the viewer has finished watching the movie, they are perfectly satisfied.The Shawshank Redemption has a Motion Picture Association of America rating of R, or restricted. This rating should be lowered too PG-13, known as Parents Strongly Cautioned. Although the movie does have slight hints at sexual activity and scenes with murders and suicide, this does not outweigh the benefit of people seeing this movie. No person of the age above thirteen, or maybe even lower, should be denied the right to view this movie. The Shawshank Redemption has the potential to have an enormous effect on the lives of those who view it. And even if it does not impact their lives, it still could easily change their perception of a good movie or just be an enjoyable two hours of their lives. Without such heavy restrictions on the age of those who can view the movie, maybe it could have a chance to be more widely viewed, and ultimately more widely appreciated.The AFI Rating of The Shawshank Redemption shows it ranked as the number seventy two American movie of the past one hundred years (AFI Top 100). I strongly disagree with this rating. The Shawshank Redemption, although it didn't cause any revelations in the movie world (mostly because it was too recent to have done so), is one of the best filmed movies of all time. I personally would rate The Shawshank Redemption in the top ten of all movies, and number one on my own personal list. The less official Internet Movie Database ranking of movies has The Shawshank Redemption as the number one movie of all time (IMDB Top 250). This is a much more agreeable rating for my own opinion on the movie. Having seen five of the top ten movies on AFI's renowned list, I do not believe any of them compare to the quality and entertainment value of The Shawshank Redemption. Although I earlier agreed with AFI's rating of The Shawshank Redemption in the top one hundred, I believe it should be much higher than the ranking they decided on.Overall, the Shawshank Redemption is a movie that will go down in history as one of the best movies ever created. This future historical relevance is not an exaggeration. If anything, The Shawshank Redemption is an underrated movie. It's not too often that there comes a movie that is as well made as The Shawshank Redemption, so when one is, it is important to fully appreciate it. The Shawshank Redemption is a grade A movie made up of the perfect components of story and acting which come together to make one of the best movies of all time. \n",

      "This is not a movie to be watched just for the heck of it. You can't just stumble upon it as you can when looking for an action or comedy movie. Not to say that it can't happen, but if you're going to watch this movie, you have to focus on it and watch it all the way through within a week. I don't know if it is a good representation of modern prisons or prisons from the time it takes place, but regardless of that, you feel for the two protagonists. I found the predicament of Andy to be completely horrific and unfair (though I wish I could find a better word to use here than \"unfair\"). Some people might find the message of hope to be kind of corny, which is a view that I can understand but don't share and I'm a guy that finds many things to be corny. The life of the prisoners is brutal, partly because of the guards, but partly because of the conduct of the prisoners. Andy is easy to sympathize with, but also easy to root for because of his perseverance and hope. I like Morgan Freeman's character, Red, too. There is an air of dignity that sets him and Andy apart from the other prisoners. The one rather implausible character point that I found was Andy's selflessness. His ability to sympathize with his fellow inmates and his willingness to better their lives does not necessarily do anything to his desire for the same benefits that they reap. His motive is certainly to help his fellow inmates, but I don't feel like he would as a human just let his hard earned rewards be wasted. The one other main character is the warden, who can either be viewed as a good heartless villain or a guy that the screenwriters forced a mean personality onto with no good reason. I'm not saying that either one is true, it just depends on where you're coming from. I read another review that criticizes the way the warden's quoting of the bible is sort of demonized and was a biased act by the producers. Personally, I disagree with that, because there are plenty of people in real life who use biblical passages and religious motives as an excuse to do bad things. One thing about his character that I didn't really understand was why he is so reluctant to let Andy go free. The story is rather like that of Mr. Holland's Opus in the sense that it is divided up by the minor characters that come and go throughout. You can see how Andy and Red make a difference in the lives of the other inmates and each other. The mystery of how Andy escapes at the end is pretty good, but not something that requires you to have remembered a lot of things from earlier to understand. For anyone considering watching it, I would recommend that you watch it alone or with someone who won't talk through it. Also, don't watch it if you're looking for anything outside of a good or emotional story. Overall Rating: 8.9/10 \n",

      "I have forgotten how many times I have seen this outstanding, heart wrenching film.From start to finish, it has you captured into what life was like for an innocent man in the harshest prisons in America. The main character is of all things, a banker. He is framed for the murder of his wife playing away with another lover behind his back. Next thing you know the husband lands in prison and fighting to stay alive from all the inmates and prison officers. Luckily his accountancy profession saves him and rewards him at the same time. He makes friends with RED and ends up building up the library to a delux place of relaxation, reading and music playing for all the prisoners.The ending just blew my mind.You must see this film, but be warned.....it is absolutely addictive viewing. \n",

      "Sometimes, a classic can come from an unexpected source. That's the case with the Shawshank Redemption. When you only hear about the plot, you'd guess that it may be very enjoyable, but it's been done before. The film is about a prison break. That doesn't sound like an original idea. Shawshank Redemption is based on a Steven King novella named 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'. Usually, the film adaptations of Stephen King's novels aren't very strong. The picture was directed by Frank Darabont, who didn't have much of a success record back in 1994. The two leading actors are Tim Robbins, who portrays Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman, who portrays Ellis Boyd Redding (simply known as 'Red'). While they are both very good actors, you wouldn't expect them to have a perfect chemistry. The film also didn't very well in the box office upon its release. So despite all of that, this film has often been referred to as one of the best films of all time. I think that's a fair point to make. You don't expect an all-time classic going into the Shawshank Redemption, but that's exactly what you're going to get. This films sucks you in and blows you away.Andy Dufresne is sent to Shawshank prison in 1947 because he murdered his wife and her lover, or so we believe. He's very introvert at first and doesn't interact with any of the prisoners. That is, however, until he asks Red if he could get Rita Hayworth to Shawshank. Red simply replies that it will take a little while, but he'll manage, since he's a man who knows how to get things. It eventually turns out to be a poster of Hayworth. When Red asks Andy why committed the crime he's been sentenced for, Andy states he's innocent. Of course every other prisoner in Shawshank state that they are innocent, except for Red, who tells Andy he's the only guilty man in the prison. Red and Andy develop a friendship over the years and the chemistry between the two is simply amazing. Andy befriends most of Red's friends, like Heywood (played by William Sadler) and the old man named Brooks Hatlen (played by James Whitmore). Andy's first couple of years in Shawshank are extremely difficult. The 'sisters' have an eye on him and especially their leader, Bogs (played by Mark Rolston). They attempt to rape Andy on several occasions. The prison is run by the corrupted warden named Samuel Norton (played by Bob Gunton) and his chief of the guards, Byron Hadley, who brutally assaults prisoners to demonstrate his power. In May of 1949, Red and his friends are selected to tar the roof of Shawshank, which keeps them outdoors for a couple of days. Andy confronts Byron Hadley about his financial issues. This eventually leads to an improved prison live for Andy and his friends. Andy helps the prison guards with their financial situation and eventually even does all of the wardens finances. In 1954, Brooks Hatlen is released from Shawshank after having stayed there for 50 years. He can't live a normal live outside of the prison walls and decides to hang himself. Red clarifies that Brook has become institutionalized. After Bogs and the 'sisters' nearly beat Andy to death, Byron Hadley assaults Bogs so so hard he is never able to walk again. Andy continues to control the wardens finances and explains to Red how all the 'dirty' money is washed clean. He made up a person on paper, named Randall Stevens, so all the trails lead to him, but because he's fictional, the I.R.S won't be able to catch anybody. In 1965, Tommy (played by Gil Bellows) arrives in Shawshank for a two year sentence. He's a young guy who loves Rock and Roll. He wants to be educated and Andy starts to teach him. At one point, Tommy hears Andy's story and reveals that Andy is innocent. Andy confronts the warden with this statement, but he's afraid Andy will reveal to the outside world what happens within the walls of Shawshank, so he puts Andy in isolation for two months. During his stretch in isolation, Tommy gets killed by Byron Hadley, because he knew too much, although the warden says he tried to escape. Andy meets Red after getting out of the isolation cell and tells him about his future plans, although Red waves it off by stating Andy's being unrealistic. Andy tells Red to never give up hope. Andy decides he's been in prison long enough and escapes through a tunnel he dug during his time in prison. The following day, Andy travels to Zihuatanejo, a place in Mexico. He leaves with half of Norton's money. The next morning, Byron Hadley is arrested for being a corrupt guard and the warden shoots a bullet through his own skull. After serving 40 years, Red is released from Shawshank. He goes through the same motions as Brooks did and you get the feeling he'll also hang himself, until he remembers he made a promise to Andy, so he searches for an old oak tree near Buxton and finds some money Andy's left for him. He decides to make the trip to Mexico and rejoices with his old friend Andy, while stating he finally dares to hope.This is, simply put, the best film ever created. It's incredibly powerful. The film really sucked me in. The chemistry between Andy and Red is undeniable and the performances from Robbins and Freeman are superb. The supportive cast also does a fantastic job. Clancy Brown as Byron Hadley really looks like a despicable bully and Bob Gunton as Samuel Norton plays his role as the corrupt warden perfectly. This film never drags and the remains entertaining for all of its 142 minutes. Films, in my opinion, don't get any better than the Shawshank Redemption. \n",

      "An excellent thriller movie to watch! So many years passed but it is still a superb movie. Freeman has played an excellent role in the movie.I wish if this movie had some kind of sequel. The movie is that much great that if we watch if 100 times we'll still enjoy it. I really liked the movie because of it's thriller. I liked the movie \" Shutter Island\" because it is as thrilling as this one. The part where Andy gets to know about the killer is the most awesome part of the movie. The best part after that was the escape through a dirty place, everything in the movie was fantastic. I do not have the words to praise this movie. Even 1000 lines are not enough for it. \n",

      "An amazing movie. One of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time...Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best. A true classic. If you haven't seen it, I recommend you go watch it as soon as possible!After being convicted of murdering his wife, something he denies, smart and banker Andy Duffrain (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank prison, which is run by a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton). He makes friends with some of the inmates but his closest relationship is with Red (Morgan Freeman) a wise lifer who is a you want it, he can get sort of guy. After many years there, and after the last straw from the warden, Andy does something that will be remembered throughout the history of Shawshank prison. The lot of this film is equally incredible with story and characters, we love whats going on the entire film because every moment is important to the ending of the film, and the characters of the movie are just perfection, Andy and Red as best friends is probably the greatest friendship I have ever seen a film and that makes it impossible to dislike them and how colorful and fun the supporting characters are, what an incredible and beautiful movie that shows the horrors of prison. The cast is just incredible, Tim Robbins plays his most memorable and best performance of his career if you ask me, and Morgan Freeman has also his greatest role to date and truly deserved his Oscar as much as everyone else that year, they were just incredible. \n",

      "When I started watching the movie, I thought: This is going to be another one of those movies drama in prison, where the guy suffers and escapes and lives happily forever. Just waiting there. Not so. The film reaches the spiritual side of things. Shows how this affects people psychologically. Having cut his freedom is yes, one of the worst things in the world, even when there is no fault. But when you get used to the place, the rules, what is inside you, it becomes your place, your truth. And then you go out. Now what? How do I live? I do not know no more walking on the street! This can really drive someone insane. Another important point is the issue of corruption in jail. Not that common place fell to be the focus of this thing. Was already structured, it was not something that needed to be nor explained. Corruption in the chain is already so common to us, which is not something that needs 20 minutes of film to explain how it works - despite the great scene in the library where Andy pro account as Red in Shawshank laundering scheme works. \n",

      "The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable. \n",

      "Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. Anyone who read the Stephen King novel knows red turns from a white guy to a black one. and the guard casually ripping the poster at the end is different but other than those small changes, everything else is on point. This is the best prison movie ever made in my opinion. Certain ironies play out very well in this film. For instance the head sister who get cripple when Andy has had enough of his ilk. A 'life-affirming' tale about life imprisonment, The Shawshank Redemption is the kind of old-fashioned entertainment that is easily overvalued in an era of diminishing expectations. \n",

      "The Shawshank redemption is about a man who is wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to life in prison. In prison the man makes friends with the inmates while improving the prison's library. He also gives financial advice to the prison security guards and personnel. The theme of this film, The Shawshank Redemption, is about finding friendship and having hope while being at a hard time in your life. Andy Dufresne is play by Tim Robbins and is the main character who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover in a jealous rage. Morgan Freeman also plays a huge part in this film as Ellis \"Red\" Boyd. Ellis or Red as he preferred to be called in the film is Andy's best friend in prison. There are five main plot points in my opinion within this film. These points include when the inmates are betting on the new arrivals, when some of the inmates are re-tarring the roof on one of the buildings, when new library books finally arrive after all of Andy's attempts, and when the warden of Shawshank discovers that Andy has escaped. This films theme is similar to the retelling of the mythical story of \"Perseus\" by author Edith Hamilton. There are several techniques that were used throughout this film but a few really caught my attention. The first technique is a motif, this is the repeated showing of the crow that Brooks rescued and raised. The birds represent a hopefulness of freedom but it also represented the loss of hope after prison. When Brooks is released, he also sets \"Jake\" the crow free and continues to look for him in a park nearby hoping that he will return to him. However, when Jake does not return it represents the loss of hope in Brooks for life after prison. Another technique that attributed to the emotions of the film was the lighting aspects. In the scene after Andy escapes where he is standing in water while it is raining with his arms spread wide, the light is directed down on him with his back in the shadows. This lighting technique in this scene adds to the feeling of triumph, of hope and of freedom. This film absolutely reflects the feeling of hope onto the viewers. \n",

I also very much liked the way that Andy and Red bonded over the time Andy spent in prison, and the things he had done for the men in prison, like the library, and the courses he taught, and how he refused to give up his position, that moment when he played the music.

      "It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. \"I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,\" he tells Red. \"Get busy living' or get busy dying'.\" The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles? People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well.There wasn't much going for it: It had a terrible title, it was a \"prison drama\" and women don't like those, it contained almost no action, it starred actors who were respected but not big stars, and it was long at 142 minutes. Polls and rentals reflect popularity but don't explain why people value \"Shawshank\" so fervently. Maybe it plays more like a spiritual experience than a movie. It does have entertaining payoff moments (as when the guards from another prison, wearing their baseball uniforms, line up to have Andy do their taxes). But much of the movie involves quiet, solitude, and philosophical discussions about life. The moments of violence (as when Andy is sexually assaulted) are seen objectively, not exploited.The movie avoids lingering on Andy's suffering; after beatings, he's seen in medium and long shot, tactfully. The camera doesn't focus on Andy's wounds or bruises, but, like his fellow prisoners, gives him his space.The Morgan Freeman character is carrier of the film's spiritual arc. We see him at three parole hearings, after 20, 30 and 40 years. The first hearing involves storytelling trickery; the film has opened with Andy's sentencing, and then we see a parole board, and expect it's about to listen to Andy's appeal. But, no, that's when we first see Red. In his first appeal he tries to convince the board he's been rehabilitated. In the second, he just goes through the motions.There's an underlying problem. Behind bars, Red is king. He's the prison fixer, able to get you a pack of cigarettes, a little rock pick or a Rita Hayworth poster. On the outside, he has no status or identity. We've already seen what happened to the old librarian (James Whitmore), lonely and adrift in freedom.Frank Darabont wrote and directed the film, basing it on a story by Stephen King. His film grants itself a leisure that most films are afraid to risk. The movie is as deliberate, considered and thoughtful as Freeman's narration. There's a feeling in Hollywood that audiences have short attention spans and must be assaulted with fresh novelties.Tim Robbins makes Andy a man of few words, quietly spoken. He doesn't get real worked up. He is his own man, capable of keeping his head down for years and then indulging in a grand gesture, as when he plays an aria from Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro.\" (The overhead shot of the prisoners in the yard, spellbound by the music, is one of the film's epiphanies.) Because he does not volunteer himself, reach out to us or overplay his feelings, he becomes more fascinating: It is often better to wonder what a character is thinking than to know.Darabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up or upstage it. Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. \"When they put you in that cell,\" Red says, \"when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.\" Watching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I saw it. Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it does with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is our redeemer.

      "This movie title is nothing like the movie. Keep in mind that the movie was based on a book by Stephen King. For a fan of King this is not something that you would expect. The movie has very little action in it, but is about true redemption, which is not revealed until the end of the movie. Personally I love this movie. The way that the cast interacts with each other is really what gives this movie the flare that you need. The prison that it was filmed at is a real prison located in Mansfield, Ohio. It can actually be toured by the general public, as can other aspects of the movie. This is a definite must see movie for anyone who wants something that will make them think about what is important in life. \n",

They were very good choices for these characters - even they are look like totally different as the book's characters. I think they really enjoy to play their movie characters. Before I have seen this movie someone said to me, it is only a newer \"prison story\". Yes, basically it is \"only\" a prison story. But there is nothing similar to The Shawshank Redemption! I can offer this movie to anyone who like well written stories with very good acting and very good directing. \n",

The acting couldn't get any better, and in the end this is one of the most uplifting movies ever made. Yes it's very long, but it without a doubt justifies its length.Based on the Stephen King novel by the same name, it's simply the best movie ever made, it should had won best picture in 1994, and all characters performances are incredible. If you haven't watch it, just do it without thinking about it twice. \n",

      "really its a great movie.......... It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (\"looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over\"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison. \n",

It keeps you guessing about Andy's guilt until the end. The prison escape reminded me of the Count of Monte Cristo so it was especially funny that this Dumas book was mentioned in the movie. It is a great film about institutionalization. It also is a good representation of prison life in its time period. It would make a great film to watch for a Criminal Justice class.

It also contains wonderful parody's of King's other wonderful work \"Misery\", \"Stand by Me\", and also hints at the masterpiece \"The Shining\". They do a great job on \"Shawshank\" and the rest of the stories and they stick to the story lines and change so few very things.

      "This review contains spoilers, so spoiler alert!!! This film draws you in from the very beginning; from Tim Robins character coming home catching his wife cheating, to her being murdered. The theme is similar to the movie the Fugitive to me, the only difference was in the film the Fugitive, Harrison Fords character ran in the beginning, in Shaw Shank Redemption, Tim Robins Character runs towards the end, after he suffers abuse being locked up with hardened criminals in prison. I felt sorry for Tim Robins character being falsely accused and having to suffer rape, false imprisonment and lost years. One stand out theme to me in watching this film is you can imprison the man, but you cannot imprison his mind. Tim Robins Character was locked up for years but his mind was free, instead of living inside the prison, Tim Robins Character lives inside his head remembering he is good with numbers and accounting and living inside his head instead of his bad circumstances was his characters saving grace in this film. I would definitely recommend people watch this movie. If you are going through pain, sometimes it helps to see other people going through stuff more worse than you and survive, become a victor instead of a victim, and for that this is my favorite Tim Robins film. Morgan Freeman, was Morgan Freeman, even as a supporting cast he made you feel his presence, his voice, the way he chooses his words makes you can't take your eyes off him. He makes you feel his pain and his friendship with Tim Robins Character. This is a film I can see myself watching again and again when I'm having a bad day. Hope this review helps. Now go watch this movie. \n",

I cannot believe it didn't do well the way it should have compared to some non sense box office movies.I admired the kind of friendship Andy and Red had. I also admired the way Andy made his way to earn the trust of the jail guards and fellow inmates. He is indeed an intelligent man and he used it to gain something that he needed to free himself. I wish I have that kind of intelligence and persistence.The ending is really heartwarming. Seeing two old friends meeting again and ready to start over again. It is just sad that ex-cons are not given the chance to start over nowadays. \n",

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film.

      "Amazing Film really loved it, would highly recommend the film to someone who hasn't watched it great acting, amazing storyline, great performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman. I'm not really into prison movies that much but this is the best by far! great drama a must watch!. Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; \"In here's where you need it most,\" he says. \"You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch.\" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking \"that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass\" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it. \n",

Me searching for a good Morgan Freeman movie as you know he is a good actor and I've near enough watched every movie that he has been in. The tag-line said it all really 'Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.' especially the ending scene where red found the letter quoting 'hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies... your friend Andy.'The movie has absolutely got to be one of my favourite movies.

      "The whole movies are incredible but you'd hate the ending... Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank Darabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care.There are times when \"The Shawshank Redemption\" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those \"triumph of the human spirit\" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cell-block. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two. \n",

When Red is talking about how he hopes he will be able to cross the border and see Andy again, connoting the whole ending theme of the film and the bus drives into the distance.That's were they should have left it. Forget the end scene on the beach where they embrace, lovely and uplifting, sure, but too kind. Leaving it with the bus making the viewer hopeful that they will be reunited would have given a much more powerful message.Regardless, this is still a truly astounding film. \n",

Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. Best Actor in a Supporting Role nomination at least.

      "For Foucault, the prison is a creation, that is, in fact, an innovation perfected by reason of punishment since according to him, it was established with the aim of equipping a formation of more affective and usable individuals in society. This same instrument of punishment, which is also an institution of kidnapping, it is contemplated in the movie \"The Shawshank Redemption\". In the film, one realizes that prison, as Foucault argued, is contradictory. This institution of kidnapping, which is a reflection of modern society, has a higher re-educative than punitive effect. What can be observed when one of the characters gets his freedom after spending 50 years in prison, he, however, was not successful during its process of adaptation to the external mode of life and society, eventually undermining the very life. \n",

And there is some feel good moments like when Red got released and when Andy escaped from the prison after twenty years. And it was very frustrating when the student Andy was teaching got shoot because it would prove Andy innocent and for him to be set free. Andy tries his best to fit into Shawshank prison by making little stone statues and a chess set. Where does he get the stone you ask? Well you have to watch it and find out because it is the most genius plan that any prisoner has come up with to escape Shawshank.

      "(This comment contains a little summary of the film, I didn't mean to spoil the movie for you, but when you are afraid of me spoiling the movie don't read the review.)The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion. I've seen many films and this one really comes out. I think this movie is 'timeless'. It's an old movie, made in 1994 (I wasn't even born) but it doesn't feel like that when you are watching it. Alright I have to admit that you can see it on the quality of the film and on other things too. It isn't HD or something like that but it gives the film a special character that it needs to be so good. It also doesn't have all those special effects like in Life of Pi, with the tiger Richard Parker who is fully made with the computer, or in the Avengers. So it isn't spectacular in that way. I think the movie is spectacular in the way it's built up and in its plot line.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is locked up in the Shawshank State Penitentiary because he is accused of murdering his wife and her lover. In prison he gets to know smuggler Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman) and soon they become friends. Red smuggles a rock hammer in prison for Andy to make 'chess pieces'. He also gets several posters and other stuff. He makes his chess pieces, but that's not the only reason for buying his hammer. He also has some other plans. First Andy works in the washing room and sometimes he gets raped by Bogs. One day the prison needs some men to work on the roof and with a little skill Andy can arrange some beers for his fellows. They start to like him and they accept him as a friend. Slightly Andy works himself up so he can do the accountancy of the director of the prison. He decides to swindle the director and he makes up an whole new person with every legit paper a human needs. After the release of Brooks Andy takes over the library and he gives it a new boost. He receives new money for books and he can expand it. His life in prison goes well but he doesn't lose his hope and faith in a better future even though Red has warned him that hope is a dangerous thing. When you want to know the end and the rest of the film you really need to buy and watch it because after the first time there is a big chance that you will love the film and that you are going to watch it more than once. I think that every single bit of the film perfectly fits. The music, the photography, the story",

This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope. \n",

Morgan Freeman delivers the most powerful performance, I think, of his career as the very likable Red, while the then unknown to me, Tim Robbins delivers a poignant performance of an ill justified innocent who gets caught up in a web of in-prison politics and corruption. The schemes of Tim's character, Andy Dufresne with his wizardry with the abacus and knowledge of the tax system befriends the prisoners and the officers and the smug look on his face is to die for when he get his inmates a bottle of beer each to drink in the sunshine.

Sometimes we consider desire as a kind of forbidden thing where wicked things happened, however in other point, desire is a kind of driving force.

      "The Shawshank Redemption has always been one of my favorite films to watch. I was introduced to this movie by my dad, who has always been a huge fan of the film. I didn't think at first I would have liked the movie, but I was wrong. Tim Robbins plays a character called Andy; who was sentenced to prison for committing a crime he never committed. Tim Robbins did a remarkable job of playing Andy. Andy had this attitude about him that captured the audience in a special way. He was always so calm, and although he had been put in prison for something he didn't do and, was treated horribly by some of his fellow inmates; he still remained a humble individual. He didn't let these actions of others affect his life. He knew he didn't do anything wrong. He knew what kind of a man he was, and he wanted out of prison. Morgan Freeman played \"Red\" a character whom Andy befriended in prison. Just like the audience watching the film, Red was always drawn to Andy. Andy always kept Red guessing of what was to come. I always enjoyed the relationship shared between Andy and Red. It's the kind of friendship you'd want with someone-even given the circumstances in which they were living. Eventually, Andy devised a plan and escaped Shawshank. Red eventually was let out of prison and went on to find Andy. This was another one of my favorite parts of the movie; not only the fact that Andy escaped from the prison in which he didn't belong but Red and him were reunited. I think in the end despite the fact that Red and Andy were prison inmates; everyone was on their side. They had never really seemed like they belonged in prison. They seemed like they were good people. Above all I believed after so long some people just learn their lesson and deserve to be sent home. This film is truly amazing and never gets old for me. There will never be another one quite like it. \n",

At first, it is hard for him to get used to it on the inside, but when he meets Red, the guy who can get it for you, they become friends and they work their problems out together. The guards seem to like Andy after he helped Captain Hadley with his tax issues. They give Andy more privileges. They let him write letters, help the guards during Tax Season, build the Shawshank Prison Library, and teach other prisoners education. But when the new inmate Tommy, who was one of Andy's classmates for reading, is shot by Captain Hadley, Andy feels it's time for him to escape with the help of his friend Red. He tells Red that when he escapes, he plans to move down to Zihuatanejo. He tells Red that when he finally is released from the prison, he wants him to move with him. Red agrees. So then on a stormy night, Andy used a rock hammer to tunnel through the cement wall. Then he crawls through a sewer tunnel 500 yards long out to a creek. Then shortly afterwards, Captain Hadley is taken to prison after shooting the inmate Tommy, and Norton the Warden shoots himself after he sees Captain Hadley being taken away. Then the day comes, when they release Red from the prison, and like he promised Andy, he got a ticket to ride a bus down to Zihuatanejo, where he finally gets to meet his friend Andy again. \n",

      "There are standard ways to stage a prison film and standard ways to tell a story by Stephen King. But \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" based on a King novella and set in the correctional institution of the title, succeeds in avoiding the familiar.Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank Darabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care.There are times when \"The Shawshank Redemption\" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those \"triumph of the human spirit\" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cellblock. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two.When Andy is convicted of his wife's murder, the judge pronounces him \"a particularly remorseless and icy man.\" He sustains that chill when he first arrives at Shawshank, remaining aloof from other inmates even when those inmates threaten him with physical harm. \"I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight,\" says Red, who knows Andy has been gang-raped by fellow prisoners, in one of the film's only halfway-brutal episodes. \"I wish I could tell you that, but prison is no fairy-tale world.\"Needless to say, the heroes of such stories usually do succeed in defending themselves, at least when Hollywood is telling the fairy tale. But \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has its own brand of iconoclasm, with Mr. Darabont's direction as quiet, purposeful and secretive as Andy is himself.Eventually Andy begins to fit in, especially after he wows the guards with skills left over from his pre-prison banking career. From the first time he advises one guard to make a one-time-only tax-free gift to his wife, Andy gets a new lease on life as \"a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.\"Andy does special fiscal favors for the warden. (\"You know, the funny thing is, on the outside I was an honest man, straight as an arrow,\" he says about this. \"I had to come to prison to be a crook.\") He also makes the occasional dramatic gesture, like commandeering the prison's loudspeaker and playing a Mozart aria for all his fellow inmates. The film has a tendency to wax romantic at such moments, but more often it sustains an intelligent reserve.Mr. Freeman is so quietly impressive here that there's reason to wish Red's role had more range. As written, he spends his time observing Andy fondly and describing prison life. But Mr. Freeman's commanding presence makes him a much stronger figure than that. Mr. Freeman is especially moving when he suggests how dependent Red has become on the prison walls that give shape to his life. Even so, Red has kept his ruefulness. \"Only guilty man in Shawshank,\" he jokes about himself.Mr. Robbins has the trickier role of someone whose still waters run deep, but whose experience doesn't add up until an exposition-packed denouement. (The film's swift, enjoyably far-fetched closing scenes are a sharp reminder of who is the author of this story, after all.) Andy's is the more subdued role, but Mr. Robbins plays it intensely, and he ages effectively from newcomer to father figure during the story. One of Andy's projects is improving the prison library, which once contained nothing but the equivalent of books by Stephen King.To raise funds for this undertaking, Andy is steady and patient, writing weekly letters to state officials until he gets what he wants. Mr. Darabont, a screenwriter making an impressive directorial debut, works in much the same quietly persistent way. \"The Shawshank Conspiracy\" takes shape slowly and carefully, displaying an overall subtlety that's surprising in a movie of this genre. In the end, like Andy and Red, it gets to where it wanted to go.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and occasional violence, including a scene that discreetly suggests homosexual rape.THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION Written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the novella \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,\" by Stephen King; director of photography, Roger Deakins; edited by Richard Francis- Bruce; music by Tom Newman; production designer, Terence Marsh; produced by Niki Marvin; released by Columbia Pictures.

Much of the film story revolves around Andy and the friendships he makes in the barbarous environment that is a prison.It the best films from the 90s but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" for me trails \"The Lion King\",\"Forest Gump\", \"Pulp Fiction\" & possibly even \"Leon: The Professional\" for best films of 1994.

Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view.

If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well.

      "This movie is based on a novel by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goof ball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967. Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form. The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle. If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word. \n",

While Morgan Freeman's performance and narration are tour DE force, the support cast is outstanding. Even the ancient James Whitmore has a good role in this one.I noted on the credits that Steven King contributed to his writing being converted into a movie. There is no doubt this one benefits from that. Tim Robbins is at the top of his game here too. Frank Darabont directs and writes this movie and the viewer gets the feeling that the director pictured how the story should be told when he wrote it along with when he directed it.This movie is the ultimate trip about injustice and justice within the prison system. It draws deep characters for each role which seem to take advantage of each cast members skills. It also is a the ultimate triumph over despair.

I love the pure bliss of Tim Robbins when he does something good for his inmates. And I love the end, so perfect and happy and hopeful! Never disappoints :) \n",

      "This move is remarkable every time I watch it. The cinematography, music, character development and everything the movie captures only happens so often. In the beginning you watch as Anthony's wife cheats on him and implies he's the murderer. When in court you have mixed feelings. Did he murder his wife and lover? all the evidence is there. Though how Anthony presented himself shows what kind of character he is. As he enters Shawshank, I personally got a sickening feeling of what he was about to experience. Though excitement too. How was this man going to survive a prison. When Morgan Freeman's Character ( Red ) enters the story, he speaks so much of routine and what the life. Breaking reality from fantasy when he says \" There's no fairy tales in Shawshank \" implying everything you fear what would happened. Did happen. Although, one of the most uplifting parts is with Anthony breaks free. He sends a letter to Red telling him \" Hope is a good thing. It's never wrong to hope. Good things don't die\" This message speaks so profoundly, after Brooks death and the dependency on Shawshank. That message speak so profoundly. This movie is more than a 10/10. It captures everything it wants and needs to then some. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who enjoys a good film. \n",

The adaptation of the Stephen King novel is so entertaining, filled with interesting dialogue and plot twists. A pretty much perfect prison film. Great performances by Robbins and Freeman. One moment really got to me: the moment when Andy crawls out of the sewer tunnel and stares up at the sky in the rain. Such a glorious moment of triumph, I wanted to stand up and scream \"Yes!\". This movie truly depicted that prison life in the fifties was just as hard for new prisoners as it is implied today. The movie didn't sugar coat Andy's prison life.

There is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema. I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope. Who is your Andy Dufresne? \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10 \n",

      "Robbins and Freeman have the juice as actors to make figuring out whether Andy and Red really did it a riveting guessing game, especially if you're a sucker for prison melodramas. Writer Frank Darabont (The Fly II), in his feature-directing debut, doesn't skimp on the caged-bird clichés, sadistic and sentimental, but he plays enough hardball with the formula to evoke memories of such goodies as Cool Hand Luke, Birdman of Alcatraz and Riot in Cell Block II.Stephen King wrote the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, on which the film is based. (Andy's cell is bedecked with a poster of Hayworth in all her Gilda glory.)

The Shawshank redemption a movie directed by Frank Darabont The Shawshank Redemption is an American drama film made by writer Stephen King from the beginning, with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in the lead roles. The film is about the successful banker Andy ( Tim Robbins ) who is wrongly convicted for murder of his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison for life. This is one of the toughest prisons in the United States during the 1940s. There he meets Red ( Morgan Freeman ) as they quickly becomes very good friends. Years after years Andy just gets more and more famous among the guards, and the prisoners, and it ends with Andy helps a guard to get $ 25,000 as a gift. Then the police- officer Norton realizes that Andy might be useful, so he started taking care of the prison economy. It causes him to get control of what happens in the prison and it gives him great opportunities to escape from the prison. The film has a strong and important purpose that you should never give up and always have hopes for what will happen. That trust is a big impact on relationships, The film can be viewed by anyone of any age and it is a very good and interesting movie. It defiantly deserves better because it is a touching movie and very inspiring. \n",

      "Excellent inspirational movie to watch... extreme worth to spent time on this Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in \"The Shawshank Redemption;\" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Citizen Kane.\" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. \n",

      "This movie is just awesomely brilliant. Okay, English teachers may not like that description, but simply put, this movie is one great movie. This movie is about a prison in Maine named Shawshank. A wealthy banker, Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) is arrested, charged, and convicted for murdering his wife and her lover. He claims that he did not do it, but the evidence points directly to him. He claims that he is innocent, but so does everybody else in Shawshank. Andy, though, proclaims his innocence right through to the end. He says \"the only time I became crooked was when I came to Shawshank\".The Shawshank Redemption is adapted from the Stephen King novel \"Rita Heywood and the Shawshank Redemption\", and as is typical for Stephen King, the horror comes not from the supernatural but from the natural. The horror here is of being thrown into prison an innocent man, and then never being able to leave because of the corruption all around. Andy is clearly innocent by the closing stages of the movie, but by that time he is such a key element to the Warden's plans, that there is no way he is ever going to be allowed to leave. Ebert speaks of the horror of time and of daily routine here, but more so there is the sense of alienation. Once one is inside the walls one can never really leave. When one prisoner, Brooks Halten (James Whitmore) is released, he kills himself due to the fact that he is free. Red (Morgan Freeman) says when he is finally released, that without the strict routine of the prison system and with the freedom of daily life, he just cannot cope.Andy is different, he has hope, and he retains this hope right through until the end. We do not see the big picture until the end of the movie, when we are revealed all, but Andy remains calm, patient, and resolute, knowing that in the end he is going to be free. He is also an opportunist, he sees an opportunity and he takes it, and when he does, he gains the friends that he needs to survive in the prison. He is not a pushover, for when the sisters seek to violate them, he fights, and he fights brutally, but he knows that in the end he will be out and he puts up with it.This movie is about hope. It is not a fantasy: Red says \"if this was a fantasy then he would have fought them off and everything would have been fine, but it is not.\" This is real and King has pulled no punches. Yet also the hope is there; we see real characters with real fallibilities. Even Andy falls occasionally and is blackmailed into submission, but he has that hope and he always looks forward to freedom. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is another Stephen King book based movie made my Frank Darabont. I have said earlier that when Darabont makes a movie based on a Stephen King book, it simply results in magic on screen, and The Shawshank Redemption is almost a perfect example of that. Despite receiving very positive reviews from critics, developing a cult following, this film failed to well at the Box Office and barely managed to recover it's costs.It's a shame really because this film deserves better, it is one of the best films of the 90s and an excellent film, with a very deep and engaging plot. Shawshank Redemption is a movie based on Prison Life and follows the life of two prisoners who become close friends. Darabont also made another movie based on Prison Life, The Green Mile, also based on a Stephen King book. However the former is a more realistic portrayal of prison life, it shows the harsh life of prisons even back in the 1940s-60s and the hostile environment, prison life is portrayed more accurately.The Plot is simply fantastic, after first 5 minutes I was just hooked, and the plot is the main reason I kept on re-watching this movie, however I did find myself struggling on the 4th viewing because the movie really starts to drag a lot at several points, and if you have watched those slow progressing scenes before they will be hard to sit through again. The movie does not try to completely serious at times, it also has it's amusing moments and some nice heart warming moments, the ending was also well done, although a dialogue exchange between Red and Dufaine would have been nice.However the plot is not really perfect, there are several unexplained things in the movie, how did Andy manage to frame the Warden or Hadley for Tommy's murder, and wouldn't revealing the Warden's illegal earnings also get Andy (who pretends to be Randall Stephens)in trouble. Also the supposed twist, that Andy didn't do it seemed unnecessary because it went nowhere, if Andy had in fact committed the murder and got his redemption, it would have added to the plot in my personal opinion. I am not going to criticize King's idea or the writers' ideas behind the story but I felt like the twist of of psychotic murderer was unnecessary. Also the films progresses years really fast, at least showing you the year on a blank screen would have cleared the confusion because even in my 4th viewing I was confused at several points, that which year it actually was, Freeman's narrating was helpful but it still lead to confusion about which year it actually is.The acting is also good, Morgan Freeman steals the show with his performance Red \"Ellis Redding\", he also narrates many parts of the film and does it excellently. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown act so well and really make you despise them. Even Adam Sandler plays the cool laid back prisoner very well. However Tim Robbin's is decent at best as Andy Dufaine, it is understandable he was a depressed character but his smirk, blank and confused facial expressions throughout the film are just tiresome, he really seems robotic, there are actors who could have done better honestly, nothing against Robbins, he can act well no doubt, he did good in Jacob's Ladder but here he doesn't stand out, not saying he is bad at all but his performance could have been better, as he was the lead it would have added more to the film. The music is nice it fits the movie and many scenes very well. And the direction is also done very well, the portrayal of prison life is very accurate and realistic. The film's message about hope and friendship is also mesmerizing.The Shawshank Redemption is an underrated gem, an excellent film with an in-depth that deserved much more acclaim and commercial success at its time of release. However it is not perfect, has it's share of mistakes and is simply not the greatest movie ever made as IMDb top 250 lists it.Overall: 9/10 \n",

      "There are few movies ever made that require no justification as to why some (or in this case almost everyone) considers it a classic, Shawshank Redemption is one of those films.Shawshank lives onto this day in such high esteem that it feels almost pitiless to do a \"normal\" review of the film for by now almost everyone out there has seen or knows of the movie that inspired us to \"Get busy living, or get busy dying\" a movie that after watching it makes you feel like you could achieve anything or escape any prison either physically or metaphorically.Upon re-watching the movie for the umpteenth time it occurred to me that there are so many reasons as to why Shawshank is the film it is, a film that has so many elements that are truly classic. Here are some of the points in the film that to me make this movie endlessly rewarding and virtually as flawless as a movie could ever aim to be.Shawshank Prison: is there anything more foreboding than the flying camera zooming over the prison grounds as a bus of \"fresh fish\" arrives? Shawshank acts as a character in itself both endlessly scary yet sadly home to many convicted men.Morgan Freeman as Red: introducing the world to the now overused but never better voice over work of Freeman, Shawshank offered Freeman the role of his career as wise and deep thinking Red, a character everyone feels an affection towards.Thomas Newman's score: crafting a score that ranges from the haunting to the uplifting, Newman's score for Shawshank is a work of a true musically genius and has cues that to this day are used in all manners of film and other advertising. Try not to feel emotion as the music kicks in as Brook's leaves prison.The Script: turning Stephen Kings short story into an epic 2 hour plus feature film may have to some seemed like a pipe dream but what Darabont did with the script is nothing short of a magnificent work by a wordsmith that will never top what he did here. Classic examples include: \"Bad luck, I guess. It floats around. It's got to land on somebody. It was my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado. I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has\" or \"The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They march you in naked as the day you were born, skin burning and half blind from that delousing s**t they throw on you, and when they put you in that cell",
      " and those bars slam home",
      " that's when you know it's for real. A whole life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it\".The story: The journey Tim Robbins's Andy takes over 20 years in Shawshank is one we the viewer's feel like we take to. Never more so have we felt the sweat of prison workshops like we do here, the feeling of relief in times of outdoor recess or the fear of guards lying in wait to throw us in the \"hole\" or react with their batons. Shawshank is more than a prison movie however it is a life affirming tale of hope, loss and friendship.The Shawshank Redemption will continue to live on and be a part of best of lists, a future it deserves. Upon reflection and re-watch I can say one thing for certain and use a word that did not exist when Shawshank first entered our world.

Morgan Freeman has griped the narration aspects its why the has gained Oscar for best actor in leading role. On the other side Tim Robbins had played as Andy tremendously well but sometimes he is unable to form bridge to audience. The story of Brooks is very emotional and heartbroken. At the time Brooks hung himself he carves in the wood \"Brooks was here\" in his apartment and then Red added to it \"And so was Red\". The creation of this types of scenes will surely add a step further to won Oscar in best cinematography. I love that film because it had great impact on emotions and hopes. We can say that the Shawshank envelops friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. The film contain very good quote that \"Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\" Andy Dufresne.

      "The Shawshank Redemption by Frank Darabont is a classic film that tells the story of a man who overcomes the worst hardship and uses his wit to deceive his authorities. The audience follows a man named Andy Dufrense through both the most terrible, and the most heartwarming events imaginable. As the film progresses, viewers develop a connection with the main characters as suspense builds with each succeeding event (Ebert). Camera angles are important in every movie from romance films to action films to comedies; however in a film that is as emotionally connected as the Shawshank Redemption, camera angles are one of the primary reasons this movie is so renowned. This original story by Stephen King obviously laid a great foundation for Darabont's film; however the film uses different angles to enhance scene suspense something that a book cannot do. Frank Darabont's use of specific camera angles throughout the film draws the audience closer to the characters, creating an intimate relationship that makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the best movies of all time. Darabont's choice of camera angle develops a connection between Andy and the audience watching him, making for a much stronger overall film. The first demonstration of brilliant camera angle is the court scene, which shows up early in the film. The camera slowly zooms into his face, revealing his expression of complete shock and awe. This is critical because it gets the audience to realize the pain he is in at the moment. The next moment of noticeable camera work is when Andy is locked into his cell. The camera follows him through the hallway, and then enters the cell with him. The tiny detail to have the camera join Andy in the dark cell connects the audience in a way that literature cannot. At this point, the audience feels the harsh entrapment that Andy feels. The next catastrophic scene in the movie is Andy's rape. The camera does something here that works perfectly at making viewers feel horrible for the protagonist. It shows Andy alone in the laundry room, yet uses the single light source to show only the dark side of his body. As opposed to telling us that he is terribly depressed, the camera angle uses darkness to reveal how he feels. Towards the end of the movie, the camera uses one last movement that truly stands out. Darabont chose to both zoom out and tilt the camera down to give the sensation of rising into the sky. Viewers feel the same sense of freedom that Andy feels that that moment. The view-points of these events give the movie an upper hand to written version. Although the camera doesn't put these events in Andy's point of view, it still manages to make observers feel exactly what he is. Each of these choices in camera movement makes its own unique statement, yet they all bond spectators to Andy by stimulating our intrigue, sorrow, or joy. Camera angle is frequently used to build suspense throughout the movie which draws the audience in and holds them there. The first immensely suspenseful scene is when 'the sisters' rape Andy after beating him up. The camera uses a dolly shot to fade away from the men, while simultaneously moving behind a corner so the audience cannot see all of the horrible events happening to Andy. The rest of the event is left up to imagination, which makes the spectators think about how Andy feels. The camera movement itself is suspenseful in its nature. The next suspense-building scene is the book-shelving scene in the library that Andy took over. The camera shows Andy and Red's conversation from shelf to shelf, making them pause between each of their statements. At this point, they were talking about Andy's cunning in taking over the warden's financial situation. Each time they move, the camera pans with them, forcing them to pause their conversation, which obviously leads the audience to anticipationwondering what will be said next. Another great example is Red's journey out of the Shawshank Prison. The point of view switches over to Red, however the camera's talent of building suspense remains the same. Brooks left the prison before Red, and took a journey through town to a halfway house, where he hangs himself, leaving a note: 'Brooks was here.' Once Red is released, he follows Brooks' exact journey from location to location, and then etches into the walls next to Brooks' note 'so was Red.' The camera focuses on the writing on the wall so the audience cannot see whether or not Red hung himself just like Brooks. After this, the director utilizes pedestal movement to slowly reveal the rest of the room, and it is discovered that Red did not hang himself, relieving the audience instantly. In this instance, the camera helped the movie build suspense where the book version would not be able to. After this scene, as the movie is finishing up, the audience is taken to the orchards with Red, in search of the note Andy left for him. This is one last moment of suspense because of the camera angle. It tracks Red along the stone wall, but never shows us what he sees, leaving the viewer's asking 'will he find the special package or not?' Resolving the situation is in Red's hands, and the camera helps to build suspense until he finally sees the unique rock. Often, words with a story can create enough suspense to draw a group of people in; yet adding unique viewpoints will maximize the anticipation in most any movie.Though The Shawshank Redemption never earned any Oscars, it received seven nominations for multiple awards including best picture.This movie has not received all of the popular accolades it deserves, yet that doesn't take away from its brilliance. \n",

      "\"Get busy living or get busy dying\" An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top \"prison\" movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! The film touches upon many subjects, including the ideas of hope, redemption, love, loneliness, justice, life/death, friendship, endurance, fear, patience, inspiration and so much more. Watching this movie always makes me feel a million times better, and if that's not the greatest reason to watch a film, I don't know what is. Give it up to both Freeman and Robbins for completely engulfing their characters with heart, soul and the spirit of humanity. I appreciated the message in this film, I absolutely loved the way it ended, I surrendered to its pace, I enjoyed all of its characters, I thought it was wonderfully photographed, I loved the score and I could seriously watch this movie 10 times a year and not bat an eyelash the whole way through. And what kind of banner year was 1994?? PULP FICTION, FORREST GUMP, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (one of my favorite romantic comedies of all-time) were all nominated for Best Picture. It's really too bad that most everyone got swept by that chocolate-lover, but no matter what the Academy deemed \"better\" that year, it goes without saying that SHAWSHANK has developed an even greater audience and following since that time, and is probably one of the most appreciated movies from the past twenty years (I usually NEVER hyperbolize any of my reviews (this is the BEST EVER...this is the WORST EVER...), but in this case, this film takes that cake and damn well, eats it too!). Love it, watch it, get your own motivation from it and surrender to its spirit which gives anyone in the world hope to do whatever they dream to do in life. It's like I quoted back at the top of this review, you better \"get busy living, or get busy dying\". It don't get more black and white than that. Your choice. A true cinematic inspiration.

      "the Shawshank redemption is the best movie I have ever seen! defiantly worth the watch!! it is so amazing how Andy spent years having patience to dig out that tunnel so he can escape. And the scene where the librarian hangs himself because he doesn't know what to do with his life touched my heart, it is truly amazing how one can adapt to an environment no matter how bad to the point if they leave there lost. I defiantly recommend this to everyone! it is amazing to look into the life of a prisoner and see and in a way experience what they did in prison, to watch Andy progress through the years and to change things in the prison is amazing. and I defiantly love the chess pieces it gives the storyline a great prospective of the character. I love how Andy affects each prisoner and how it shows that when Ellis finally gets parole that he actually goes to the place Andy asked him too. absolutely amazing! \n",

      "I thought the movie was great. All of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. It tells the story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek. \n",

      "A Review of The Shawshank RedemptionThis film acts like a commentary on prison life for long term prisoners, but its real theme is one of hope. It draws us in quickly with the drama of a cheating wife and the actions of a scorned husband. However, what really brings us in are the deep soothing tones of Morgan Freeman's (Driving Miss Daisy, Unforgiven) voice-over as Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding speaking about his insights into Andy Dufresne.Andy Dufresne is the scorned husband, played by Tim Robbins (Bull Durham, Mystic River), who is accused and convicted of murder even though the evidence is circumstantial and he maintains his innocence. He spends the next twenty years at Shawshank State Prison where he meets Red. Red is one of the guys in the prison who has a way of getting anything one might want smuggled into the prison. One of the first things that Red notices about Andy is that he conducts himself as a free man who is unaffected by the surrounding prison. Andy has difficulty at first as he falls prey to a group of inmates called \"the sisters\" and referred to as bull queers. This goes on until Andy shows his worth as banker to the lead guard, Captain Hadley played by Clancy Brown (Highlander, Starship Troopers). Hadley provided Andy's inmates with beer in exchange for Andy's services. The beer made the inmates feel like free men again and Andy's services got him noticed by the warden. The warden, played by Bob Gunton (Patch Adams, Evita), provided Andy with protection from the \"sisters\", allowed him to fix-up the library, and allowed him to help some inmates earn their high school diplomas in exchange for Andy's help with laundering money that proceeded from the warden's many schemes. So, we are presented with a bleak situation that is reinforced by dirty sets and mostly gray and blue colors. The make-up used to age the actors gradually over twenty years, combined with the acting, work together to make us believe that all of this could happen and is real. We are made to feel sorry for these inmates most of whom are suffering the consequences of their own horrible crimes. And, as if doing the dirty work of the self-righteous who stand in judgment over Andy isn't enough, the warden has the one person who can get Andy out of prison executed. In spite of all of this Andy maintains a hope for the future that \"they\" can't touch. The Shawshank Redemption is a really good film that leaves the viewer with a feeling of triumph and a life lesson that goes beyond prison walls. \n",

I want them to add more graphics get new actors and also try and get better locations.What I really like about this movie is that it really captures that feeling of reconnecting with people and how hard that can actually be. As I'm slowly closing in on 40 you see that you do not see the friends you hung out with as much anymore. You still talk to them and get along, but do not have the same connection anymore, simply because you do not share as much anymore as you are used to. Of course those relationships have been pushed to comedic proportions and are a great source for a lot of laughs. Simon Pegg steals the show as the boy trapped in a man's body and the story which initially starts out like a pub crawl soon turns into a pub brawl and an awesome one at that. \n",

When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward.

But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul. \n",

      "Review #1 of \"My Top ten Favorite Movies\" Reviews I'm not going to go through a whole review, since there are plenty of reviews detailing why this is the greatest movie of all time. I'm just gonna give a quote:\"The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen because of its ability to capture raw emotion.\" I'm also going to elaborate on the three biggest reasons people dislike this movie.1. It's too slow.The Shawshank Redemption may be a tad slow, but it is justified. I believe director Frank Darabont wanted to show Andy's time at Shawshank by showing how slow prison time really is. Some movies are just slow; this movie does it for a deeper reason, adding to Shawshank's genius.2. Andy Dufresne barely shows emotion.Those people obviously didn't get what kind of character Andy was. Tim Robbins did this on purpose. Andy was quiet, mellow, and was obviously quite shocked and angry he was going to prison for a crime he didn't do. Did you really expect the man to jump up and start singing \"Kumbaya\"? No! So I don't get what the problem is. The fact that he acted like this just added to the realistic atmosphere of the movie.3. This is not realistic.Oh yes your right, since these men in prison smoked, cursed, drank, and kept their eyes peeled in the shower room for potential rapists. That is not realistic at all. (sarcastic) Overall, I think some of the hate on Shawshank is solely because it is the highest rated movie on IMDb, for a fact. (User rating is 9.3 to this date). I think some people hate this movie because everyone else loves it, and that is a bad way to think about anything, not just movies.HandHStudios Rating: 10/10, and everything higher. \n",

      "I'll go ahead and speak plainly about events from the movie, not caring too much about spoiling or not. If you haven't seen the movie and do not want the major plot twists told beforehand you should avoid this review.I must admit I was one of those guys who went on a hunt for this movie just because it is the highest rated movie on this website. It was second place on general public top 250 when I decided I had to see it. Not to mention most recent high-rated films I am familiar with to a point of remembering, or hearing about; this one wasn't the case.To tell the truth I watched the movie three times now and I still haven't seen anything resembling greatness to be the highest acclaimed film in the most important website about cinema in the planet.It's not bad, but I found overshadowed by the immense hype surrounding it. It's certainly 7/10 material in my book, but the idiotic fanboys along with the constant praise for it being superior film-making just slides it down a notch or two.The story about a guy that is innocently convicted and how his life develops inside the prison with a friend named Red and a few surprises here and there is well told. The so-called message it carries? Well, it seems people are all about that \"hope\" thing since he indeed is innocent of the crime he's in for, and how eventually he escapes prison leaving behind a hostile environment that never really believed in him, a warden that exploited his dry as much as he could, and of course beating the error of the system in his own game.He loses his whole life while at it though, but who cares, it's all about hope. It's hard to relate anything to real life since even the finale seems too wonderful to be true. The guy just goes to an obscure island and lives happily ever after. Even Red drops by when he's finally out on parole. Great deal.After 30 years digging a tunnel with a miniature pickaxe after being wrongly convicted for a crime he did not commit and stealing from the corrupt warden in the process sounds the absolute catharsis for some, I thought it was sad, sad that he lost his whole life in a prison, sad that he had to put up with all that crap for so long, sad that he must have been reintegrated after a while if somehow his story went on. Call me a pessimist, but that's not hope.I sometimes wonder what so many people saw in this movie that I was the only one on planet earth who did not quite \"get it\". The only thing this movie taught me more than anything else is that democracy is not always the best regime. What did every one suddenly see that back in 1994 people did not? Maybe it's an internet this right? Internet stuff, that serious business. This strange Leviathan that transforms unknown South-Korean pop singers in music sensations and record-holders for most watched movie on the planet. The internet, maybe someone watched it and thought it would be funny to invent a secret message, so deep, so unworldly, so incredible and anyone who could not \"see it\" was instantly deemed unworthy.That monster that drives everyone to think this average movie should be considered some kind of demigod due to its averageness. We see that because we're average, enlightened beings see greatness, colossal messages within that lifts the human spirit, cleanse our souls with its reach.The movie was good, and that's about it. \n",

      "Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle. \n",

      "This is the best movie I've ever watched!! It told a moving story very effectively. Former banker Andy Dusfresne is wrongly convicted for a double murder and sent to Shawshank Prison. The first few years are a struggle but he eventually carves out for a place for himself and benefits the other inmates in the process, winning favours through helping the guards and warden with financial planning and expanding the prison's meagre library. He becomes solid friends with Red, a black man who entered 20 years before and is highly resourceful. What resonates with the audience is Andy's clinging to hope. The saddest part was when the boy that Andy had been tutoring obtained a high school diploma, but shortly after, was shot dead under the warden's orders as he had knowledge that could prove Andy innocent. Following that, Red tells Andy that hope is a dangerous thing. Bur further events prove that hope is in fact a good thing (as Andy tells Red in a letter) - Andy escapes through a hole he dug in his cell wall (hidden behind a large poster of a hot woman) and escapes to Mexico using a false identity and cash that he'd procured while laundering money for the warden. Before leaving, he submits evidence incriminating the hypocritical warden. As the cross-stitching on the warden's office wall reads, judgment does indeed come! Red is released soon after and struggles to adapt to the outside the world. But for Andy's invitation to join him, Red would probably have gone down the path of Brooks, who committed suicide.The Shawshank Redemption combined a message of hope with wonderful storytelling and attention to detail.

Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who spends nearly two decades in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation.In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the \"bull queer\" gang \"the Sisters\" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston). In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library. In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias \"Randall Stephens\". In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package. The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest. After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited. \n",

A well-educated banker imprisoned for the murder of his wife and her lover, can do just as much damage inside prison as outside working in a BANK!In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the \"bull queer\" gang \"the Sisters\" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston).In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library.In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole but, unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias \"Randall Stephens\".In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package.The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited. \n",

      "'Get busy livin' or get busy dyin', that's damn right'.A stand-out performance from the magnificent movie maestro Morgan Freeman, whom leads this spectacular motion picture with fantastic style as the enigmatic convict known as Red, earning himself a well deserved Academy Award nomination. Tim Robbins plays our main protagonist, Andy Dufresne, an innocent banker charged with the murder of his wife, a crime he did not commit. The film chronicles Dufresne's time in Shawshank Penetentiary, from the first day meeting the 'more-than welcome' guards, to dirty deals with corrupt Warden Sharp (played by a superb Bob Gunton), to befriending characters like Red and Brooks, a 70-something long-sentence server acting as librarian (played by James Whitmore, in one of his later roles) and to the momentous break-out, symbolising everything this film stands for: hope. Shawshank is the perfect movie, great story, great actors and a great director. The culmination of captivating music and scintillating atmosphere transform this movie into something more: a legend. I would thoroughly recommend this film to anyone, it is a must watch. \n",

      "The movie starts bit slow, but right from the start you will feel that you are into it. Every moment your mind will be wondering what will happen next cos you never know. The director has made great effort to make it like that. There are very few good movies that defines \"Hope\". But non can challenge this one. The movie shows how good can happen even in the worst, and to never loss hope. Morgan Freeman is another master piece in this movie. Both his acting and narration touches our heart. There are some extreme scenes in the movie that shows the reality to what happens in a Prison. How people tend to behave during the initial period and how they transform it to a routine that is to be followed every single day. I am really great full that i saw this movie and found a crucial part to believe in. If you are looking for a good classical movie that has drama, suspense and a message than this will be the best movies you will ever watch. If you are looking for a action movie and hungry for blood then this is not for you. \n",

But when I see it the second time, I understand what it is about, and how it came to be the greatest drama of all time. It benefits from a strong cast, feeling that Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman did the film themselves. They devoted to the film all they got. From expression, to heavy feelings. They look us in the eye, and expresses their demand for freedom and a life of a normal man. The film drives us from jail to out, resulting some hard to be fitted in like Brooks. It's an unique way, seeing the prisoners dealing with their life afterward, not like any other films. It has a great script, a set scene full of masterpiece coming to life after 20 years of finding it's own success.

I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Morgan Freeman and puzzle solving films. It is also and inspirational film to look up on because of the story line and all the different angles and what not. If you ever want to go to the prison in Mansfield.. The scene where Mr. Brooks hangs himself in his apt and carves his name was also shot in that very prison. I also must say that this film brought me into tears of sadness and joy.

While watching, I did not expect that the film will have happy ending so that one can think that escaping such kind of prison can never be possible. However in the end, this process became successful in a way that we can never imagine. From my point of view, with this point, aim of movie is to show that in every hard situation it is possible to succeed with just not losing hope and be optimistic about our dreams which does not let us to give up, conversely to draw conclusions even we can never imagine. This movie had really huge impact on this side. \n",

The story goes like this- Andy is send for life time imprisonment for allegedly killing his wife and her boyfriend,in jail first few years were really bad but slowly he starts to find friend and also some work.

I haven't seen the movie in a while, but I can see myself watching it tonight. My favourite part would have to be the ending when Red and Andy meet in Mexico after Andy escapes, which I might add was really cool too. How he dug a tunnel out and lead the guards off, that would take major skill if Hollywood magic didn't exist. Well, anyway, watch it. You will love it. \n",

      "The beginning of the film is remarkable, but when Andy finally gets out of solitary confinement and is sitting against the wall next to Red, you can feel the stress and the intensity of the movie. There is no other movie that I have ever seen where a silent intensity has ever been done so well. You as a member of the audience know that something is going on, and the storytelling by Morgan Freeman seals the deal. The acting in this film is remarkable, and the subplots and the heartfelt ending of the film truly make this film worthy of the number one spot on t list. The writers and casters of the film could not have selected a better actor for Andy's part than Tim Robbins, with his logical, calm, and reserved personality that reflected so well onto the film. Finally, the realization of the other inmates that Andy is in fact innocent is absolutely chilling, and has you rooting for the character all along. This film is number one on the top 250 for a reason. \n",

      "Life in ShawShank Prison coalesces criminality, corruption, death, truth, god and hope into a wonderful film starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Set in the 1940's, Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life is altered forever when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Shawshank demonstrates how quickly and naively the criminal justice system can wrongly convict a man and alter his destiny forever. Lady justice clearly is incapable of knowing all things and rendering perfect judgment.An innocent man at heart, Andy, with the help of his friend Red, showcase the life of prisoners and put on full display internal prison dynamics, the effects of lengthy prison sentences on the soul, the process of rehabilitation, and the will to survive with hope to live and fight another day. Following his conviction, Andy is tortured by a small immoral gang of rapists until the warden places him in his protective womb. In exchange for his services and help with financial matters Andy's stature grows and his influence spreads. A friendly relationship develops over the years, with Andy eventually processing tax returns, and subsequently running a fraudulent scheme for the warden. Surprise twists find its way in the form of a truth telling inmate overhearing the real killer of Andy's wife. Warden Norton wants no part in this, fearing for his operations and control of the institution. Quickly he pours ice on the idea, and subjugates Andy to physical torment to bend his will.Ever the precocious young lad, Andy secretly plots for over 20 years and reveals an astounding and ingenious strike to send Warden Norton into a suicidal finale.Shawshank is a classic, darker than The Green Mile, yet truthfully a reflection of how the system can go so very wrong. Sometimes, truth and justice are not good enough, and one must rely on himself to adequately realign the scales. \n",

It has everything you can ever ask from a movie without being cheesy or over the top on any score.I love the way the story is told by the main character himself. You can really see the life of a prisoner in there and the struggle they all go through. They somehow manage to find things to make them enjoy the time and eventually get used to the idea of staying inside the prison. They all learn to become friends but still finds enemies, like the warden and some of the guards. They are portrayed as the good guys even though they are prisoners who has committed crimes. You really bond to them through the screen and can look through their eyes. The ending of this movie, the first time I saw it, was so unexpected!

Unfortunately, I never got to see Shawshank in the theaters. I saw it on VHS and instantly fell in love with the movie. The story made me want it to go on forever. I rented the movie five times before finally buying it on VHS. I cannot recommend this movie any higher. Since I saw it the first time in 1995, no movie has approached it. Frank Darabont directed a brilliant movie and made me a fan of his movies. For a story about two men in prison, it definitely surprised me. The story will keep you hoping to find the truth and sticking around to find out how it all will end. Hope you enjoy the show! \n",

He gave such a detailed depiction of prison life in a way that has never been seen on screen but yet gave us a sense of compassion for prisoners as well.Tim Robbins gave a very phenomenal performance from start to finish. He was the guy you just always wanted to route for. His performance was great throughout the film . Robbins played Andy Dufresne who was convicted of a crime and is sentenced to prison. He has to learn to adapt to a whole new life. He be-friends an African American man named Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Red is feels as if he has no hope of ever being anything more than an inmate and is content with that. Red feels that the only way to survive is to become still to the world and try not to become institutionalized. Throughout the years Red watches his friend Andy go through a lot of things and change. Along with their good friend Brooks Halten played by James Whitmore who gave an awesome performance as well. The three experience prison life together but in different ways. Over all the cinematography, the directing and the performances were EXCELLENT! If you've never seen this film it is a definite must see.

      "As English is not my native tongue, it is a bit hard to grasp what does 'Redemption' means in Shawshank's Redemption. In my understanding, a prisoned is helpless, who can he save?It is even more confusing that Shawshank is an innocent guy. Surely the word 'revenge' will be more appropriate to replace 'redemption' in this context. As the film unfold, it becomes clear to me that Shawshank redeemed himself and others as he wasn't hateful. He calmly accept the unfairness in his life and dealt it with dignity and resilience. Some time, we are caged in a prison that's created by ourself. We often cry out 'it is unfair!' or 'It is not just!' But how often do we actually take any actions against them? Do we have the confidence that one day the prison wall will eventually get through by a small tool? Can we calmly deal with the pressure and threat that consume us mentally and physically? Are we ready to craw through a gutter that's full of sh*t to reclaim our entitled freedom?When we in despair, it is encouraging to reflect on this fictional guy - Shawshank. Life some time is not about revenging, it is about redeeming. It is easier to revenge, but cooler to redeem. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption was originally released in 1994 and at the time it didn't receive its worthy praise, its due credit for being without any doubt one of the finest movies ever made, a gargantuan picture. It felt considered to be truly great, yet nothing quite remarkable, why is that? Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are majorly responsible. Also though when you're watching The Shawshank Redemption for the first time you might take notice of how fanciful it is, seemingly sugarcoated, and may tend to initially and foolishly discount it as being a soft misrepresentation of life in Shawshank, but as the movie perseveres through gruesome incidents and never shows a single imperfection, never seizes to amaze, it gradually becomes clear that this is a powerhouse of a movie, an undisputed masterpiece, and it's not a distorted viewpoint, it's just lighthearted and viewer-friendly, and you may be required to reassess your feelings towards the film to be valued as one of the very best movies of all-time. The Shawshank Redemption is remarkable. It's one of the very few films that succeeds and even excels at depicting life on the brighter side while still maintaining enough darkly despair in proper prism. Prison isn't a fairy tale world. The Shawshank Redemption doesn't downgrade itself with a too grimy depiction; it's shown in a more pleasant way, in a more powerful way, and it's better this way, with no overstated unsavory trauma. The Shawshank Redemption is loaded with unsavory trauma, it just doesn't dwell on it. It ditches a grim outlook and upholds a faithful perspective. The Shawshank Redemption inspires great hope, even when your spirit has fallen into the darkest of places. Andy Dufresne is one of the best characters from film, period. Andy's unassuming, soft-spoken and distant nature makes him a prime target to befall victim to the hideous injustice of an ill-fated murder charge, but Andy is a brave soul, and he will seek redemption, even though Andy's very own soul is in most need of it. Andy's unfulfilled life has found new meaning in the most unlikely place, Shawshank. The story is among the best ever told. I venture to say that the narration provided by Red is the best, the very best of any movie. The narration doesn't compel you with startling plot developments, rather it guides you with reflection and comforts you throughout the indelicacies of the film. The narration is the driving force and the lasting impression of the movie. The Shawshank Redemption is mega engrossing; you do not quite know where it's heading, but you do not care because it is so good, and where it does eventually land is sheer brilliance, true movie magic. The end is simply genius, a clear metaphor for passing through hardship. I love that Red makes it to the good life too with Andy; this movie would have lost all of its might if not for its beautiful, happy ending. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare dramatic masterpieces as it's right up there on the short list of being the greatest movie of all-time. Give it its due. (Hummmmmmmmmmm...the #1 movie on the IMDb Top 250...that'll do.) \n",

      "It's a masterpiece film that will have a value all the times. Some critics think after years of adulation and promotions from fans, that Shawshank Redemption has gotten overrated. In my opinion, I think they are wrong. Never have I been so moved by film. Its intriguing without being vague, intellectual without being conceited, long without ever losing pace but most of all what all art should be inspiring. I left feeling emotionally enlightened, enriched and equally drained. Breathtaking. The score was composed by Thomas Newman was stunning. The main theme (\"End Titles\" on the soundtrack album) is perhaps best known to modern audiences as the inspirational sounding music from many movie trailers dealing with inspirational, dramatic, or romantic films. Shawshank Redemption is like wine I guess, the older it becomes the better it becomes, really bizarre how it didn't appeal much at the time 1994, it was pretty hard to beat Forrest Gump, and Pulp Fiction that year. It end up having a cult following, after years and years of being aired on cable television to the point. A lot amount of people have finally view it, and most of the time share the same opinion, it was great. You have two hours to dig into the story - and I can tell you it was worth it. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film directed by Frank Darabont tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is sent to Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation. It wasn't until he meets Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) does he heard that another inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. It was here that Andy makes a choice, continue to live with the sins in prison, or clean himself up by escaping it. The film wasn't about a grand scheme of plot. It was unusual in the sense that it didn't matter what happens, but only that the message is fulfilled: Fear can set you prisoner, hope can set you free. And it did fulfill it. Brilliantly. It is the script and the actors that make this movie so great. Morgan Freeman as Red is the highlight of the film. Before Freeman was cast, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Paul Newman, and Robert Redford were each considered for the role. Although the part was described as written as a middle-aged Irishman with graying red hair, Darabont cast Freeman for his authoritative presence and demeanor. Morgan Freeman is an amazing actor and his narrationing voice is so soothing. While I do like the narrations. Narration in films are always a sign of weakness in the story and plot. It is always used to cover up holes in the story; unless it conveys the protagonist's inner feelings and thought. Here, it conveys Red who is basically telling us what we are witnessing on the screen. While, I do like it, it wasn't really needed. The acting of Tim Robbins was great as well. I love the scene where he play a recording of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro on the loudspeaker. Still, in some scenes, he's too wooden and stiff. Furthermore, he mumbles too much. Both, Tom Hanks and Kevin Costner turn down the role, two actors I do like. I also love Bob Gunton as the Warden, but I really wanted James Crowell as the Warden. I thought it would be amazing to have him in this film. There are some many themes and messages, it's hard to count. The biggest one is the fundamental pillars of human life: hope. Some critics do have a problem with the film in some areas like attempts to persuade the viewer to side with rapists, thieves, and murderers. It didn't help that 2007, two inmates of Union County Prison escaped from their prison using similar techniques to those featured in the movie. I think the biggest fault, is that white collar crime pays if you are slick. While Andy was innocent of the murders, he wasn't innocent in white collar crimes. Another thing that some critics nitpick is the deep emotional relationship between two men. I don't see anything wrong with it, thinking it as two men being friends. Some people say it's a homosexual relationship since in prison, homosexuality is normalized. This is clear throughout the film, not only through the characters of the sisters gang, but how inmates' referral to new arrivals as \"fresh fish.\" There was also a lot of homosexual symbolism like the Rita Hayworth poster covering up something and how the sewer scene was a symbol for anal sex. If that's isn't weird enough, some critics have spotted many allegorical themes in the film, generally along the lines that Andy Dufresne is a latter day Jesus Christ. No matter what people see in it; even with some prison film clichés, it still a great film. I do like the 1963's 'Great Escape\" references with the socks. I don't want to spoil anything, but all I can say is, \"I'm glad I took the time to watch this movie\". Overall you build an understanding and feel for the characters, was real sad when certain characters died, really gets to you. The whole concept was smart, it just shocks how it was all put together and it works so well. Brilliant movie. Recommend anyone to watch it at least once in their life time. Don't take my word for it. Just watch it. So Get busy living or Get busy dying. \n",

But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made.

Fortunately, there is little need to criticize - for Shawshank really is as great as people make it out to be.It's easy to forget how much of a slow-burning success Shawshank was. Despite favorable reviews and its many nominations, the film barely broke even on first release. It was only with the VHS release that word began to spread like wildfire, so that by the turn of the century it had garnered a reputation as a modern American great. In an age where films are dead in the water if they don't perform on opening weekend, it is hard to imagine a situation in which another Shawshank could emerge (although Slumdog Millionaire is a reasonable candidate).It's equally easy to forget how brutal the film is, particularly in its first 20 minutes. Shawshank's reputation as a popular favorite might lead the uninitiated to thinking that it's an uplifting, feel-good film - and it is true that these later moments are the ones which have most entered into popular consciousness. But any film about hope needs a source of despair to provide conflict, and Shawshank has more than enough violence and emotional trauma to justify its 15 certificate. As Mark Kermode famously remarked, there's a whole lot of Shawshank before the Redemption.Even without its reputation, Shawshank is one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work. Indeed, among King's dramatic stories, it is outshone only by its successor The Green Mile. Frank Darabont has a greater understanding of King than almost any other filmmaker: he gets the tone spot on and recreates the period setting brilliantly with the help of Roger Deakins' cinematography. Despite the much-parodied narration that punctuates the film, the drama unfolds naturally and believably throughout, with the characters always being at the forefront and naked exposition being kept to a bare minimum.The characters reflect the different extents and effects of institutionalization. Brooks has built his entire identity around his books and role in the prison; he is so afraid of this being taken away that he attempts to kill William Sadler's character so he can stay inside. Red is aware of how trapped he is, and shares Brooks' fears, being unsure that he could get things for Andy on the outside. But at the same time, he refuses to let himself be vulnerable, trying to play the system and constantly getting turned down for parole. Andy allows himself to be vulnerable and endures all the pain that it brings him, sustained by the knowledge of his innocence and the hope that he will escape.Shawshank is perhaps the most powerful depiction of hope in all of cinema. The original short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, was subtitled 'Hope Springs Eternal'. The film returns to hope and the celebration of the human spirit like a leitmotif, and succeeds because it retains Andy's humanity in all its many shades. While he is very different to the other prisoners, he is never presented as a saint or goody-goody, smiling formlessly in the face of maddening torment. This makes his endurance all the more powerful: we recognize our faults in his moments of weakness, and aspire to his inner moral strength.The film has attracted many Christian interpretations - in fact, in my review of John Carpenter's The Thing, I called it \"a poster child for Christianity\". It's not hard to see why, considering its celebration of inner strength and devotion, and its overall arc of good triumph over evil against the greatest odds. While Andy has been called a Christ figure, he's just as close to the character of Daniel in the Old Testament: he finds himself in a strange land against his will, and in order to survive he applies his natural talents to the service of his temporal masters. Through his labors the people around him benefit and the system is eventually changed for the better - albeit through pain, suffering and several deaths.An equally intriguing interpretation comes from Mark Kermode, who authored a BFI Modern Classic on the film in 2003. In a video discussing cinematic depictions of Richard Nixon, Kermode made the argument that Warden Norton (played brilliantly by Bob Gunton) is an allegory for Nixon, with Andy's prison term matching Nixon's political career. Norton begins reaching out for friendship (Nixon seeking to be elected), then becomes the corrupt leader (beginning in the year that Kennedy was shot), and finally descends into paranoia and disgrace, culminating in a more literal suicide than Nixon offered us.Whether you believe these interpretations or not, Shawshank is a terrific piece of dramatic film-making which soars on the strengths of its main performers. Tim Robbins perfectly captures Andy's distant, ethereal quality while retaining his wry and infectious sense of humor. Morgan Freeman's performance may well be responsible for his subsequent type-casting, but he matches Robbins beat for beat, offsetting hope with world-weariness and guilt. There's also great support from two actors who would subsequently work with Darabont again - William Sadler (who appears in The Green Mile) and James Whitmore (The Majestic). \n",

      "The shawshank redemption was probably the best film I've ever watched. Somehow it feels like Forrest Gump. The main character, Andy trying to keep he life style despite the fact that he was in prison which is a place of no freedom, no friends.What impressed me is that Andy made Red to get a poster of Rita Hayworth and he stick it to the wall of his cell. We have been told repeatedly in most prison movie that a con should has no privacy and personal belonging, that the jailer will keep destroying everything you have and make you suffer. But Andy somehow managed to keep the sexy poster on his wall, made chess out of own time, that is impressive.To be honest, I was shocked because like everyone else I have been living a life as a slave to the work->eat->sleep->work cycle and just don't have the gut to take the leap of faith into what is waiting beyond.I believe like Andy's dream of living next to the Pacific Ocean, which he made it come true, everyone has a dream of his own and we should try our best to accomplish them. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is an impressive story that focuses on two themes. The main theme is a heart-warming story of perseverance and redemption. The sub-theme is more akin to an exposé of the penal system and the horrors that it creates. These two themes intermingle throughout the entire film until it ends with an anti-climactic revelation that Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) has not only beaten the system, personified in Warden Norton (Bob Gunton), but has also managed to save another inmate, 'Red' (Morgan Freeman), from death. The director and producer work together in an impressive combination of screenplay, lighting, sound and editing. I won't spend too much time on the screenplay, simply because I cannot do it justice. However, the writing and acting were impressive to say the least. The actors mingled in a way that very effectively reinforced the two themes stated above. During their time at Shawshank the actors progressively lose their vitality and morality. As the movie progresses all the characters show the oppressive effects of the penal system, both when it is used as designed as well as when it is abused by the Warden. Andy is no exception to this rule. I feel that the film is designed to show us that Andy would be destroyed by Shawshank as well, if he hadn't found the means to be free of it. Lighting and color were another medium that the director took advantage of to portray the misery and glory of Andy's story at Shawshank. The Shawshank Redemption was filmed with a strong preference for harsh lighting. Very rarely in the film is anyone portrayed graciously, even our main character is exemplified for his flaws. The color choices were even more indicative of the harsh realities of Shawshank prison. The prison is practically gray-washed, and would have been almost as effective if it were filmed in black-and-white. This strongly supported the sub-theme that speaks against the penal system. However, when Andy makes the choice to do something with what little freedom he has, there is a significant change in the color of the film. This is most notable in the opening and expansion of the library. During these scenes the lighting and color of the film seems to brighten considerably, showing the viewer that Andy's perseverance of attitude and self-improvement have a distinct effect on the nature of even Shawshank's oppressive walls. The sound and narration of the film also relate well to the film. The sound effects in the film are universally harsh lending weight to the oppressive atmosphere. The stark grinding of metal bars on stone, or the shuffling of inmates feet are sounds that are good examples of this. The narration serves a dual nature. It is almost necessary just to speed the progress of the film that covers a number of years of imprisonment. However, it also teaches us a lot about the history of Shawshank. The narrator's voice is old and seems weighed down with Red's own battle at Shawshank. However, it also holds a measure of Hope, a feeling that seems foreign to the gray walls of the prison. This duality of emotion exemplifies the nature of the war between the two themes of Hope and Oppression. \n",

      "The other day I saw Shwashank Redemption (yeah yeah, I had to be clobbered to watch it, more fool me). What an intense movie! Yes it is an epic movie, yes its beautifully narrated, but what struck me most was this movie reminded me of Joseph, son of Jacob in the bible.I mean look at the similarities- Joseph the favorite of Jacob, apple of his fathers eye. Joseph who dreamed about ruling over his brothers. And here we have Andy, the blue eyed genius of the banking sector, who has it all, money, position and a beautiful wife.Joseph is cheated by his brothers and sold into slavery. He is then tempted by his boss's wife, and he resists the temptation in good faith. But anyway he is falsely implicated and sent to prison. Andy gets cheated by his wife and best friend, in a fit of drunken rage Andy entertains the idea of harming then, but quickly sobers up and resists the temptation. Andy also gets falsely implicated.So now we have two innocent men in prison, but both don't let circumstances deter them. Both use their talents where they were placed and grow and rise to new heights. Joseph found favor with the warden and became in charge of the prisoners. Andy started filing tax returns for all of the prison guards and was made the library in charge.Joseph is freed from prison because of his ability to interpret dreams. Joseph is made the governor of the land and becomes very prosperous. Andy's banking skills allow him the leeway to manage his escape from prison. Andy comes across great wealth that he was managing for the warden.And finally Joseph gets reunited to his family, while Andy gets reunited with Red who was his friend from the prison.Amazing coincidence, ain't it? \n",

      "A prison escape that is technically so much better than other prison escape stories.A man wanted freedom, he redeems his life by escaping for the Shawshank prison and the man's name is Andy Dufrsne. This film is dramatic take of a man, and in a way it is similar to Escape from Alcatraz and The Great Escape. The similarity is that the above mentioned films are also prison escapes and the similarity ends there. This movie is more about hope and redemption than anything else and this is what sets this film above the other escape stories. For a man, freedom is highest value and he would do anything to get it. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is such a nice fellow that we would for sure like him for the way he is, when he chuckles at the warden when music is played in prison or when he asks for beers to his friends without having a sip. We like him because he is selfless, humane in nature. But more so, he is selfish and works towards his freedom at the same time. Now, in terms of character he has company n the firm of Red (Morgan Freeman) and what a great character, RED was, is understood, by the way he narrates the story. And thus, it's not surprising for Morgan Freeman to have garnered more best actor award nominations than Tim Robbins. The novel, written by Stephen sets it up in 1949 - 1966 period in a prison called Shawshank in Maine, USA. Frank Darabont made it into a film that's great to see but also tests our patience. It's great in terms of cinematography, lighting and costume design and even art direction, but greater was the acting by two lead characters. Just because of their acting, I was compelled to see this story of HOPE, that ends in a good way.The sound design is great and worthy of a special mention as a realistic sound the prison of 1940's to 60's was created. Editing though, I believe could have been done by cutting short a few scenes, or rather cutting out a few scenes, just like say one week of hole for Bogs. I have seen this thrice and, since I knew that this is the best rated picture on IMDb, but the more I see it, the less I started to like it, may be I know the story too very well. Maybe, I am finding fault with reasons of a prison escape done too trivially, by crawling in gutter for 500 yards or by creating a hole in the room. Or maybe, I think that Andy was just too easy and too casual on what he did. These are all my own reasons that put me down each time, I see this. Yet this has a good place in my memory and heart for I see this, just because there is hope, and HOPE IS A GOOD THING. I just love the dialogs of this film and thanks to Stephen King and Frank Darabont for that.It's a 4/5 for a movie that may not be the best in my view yet is a good one to be watching. Go listen dialogs like 'you get busy living or you get busy dying'. They are like music to ears. \n",

      "*Contain Spoilers*The Shawshank Redemption (1994) Director - Frank Darabont Cinematographer  Roger Deakins Writers  Stephen King and Frank Darabont Editor  Richard Francis-BruceFavorite Quote: \"Hope is a good thing and good things never die.\" The Shawshank Redemption is about time, patience, hope and loyalty. In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (protagonist) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis \"Red\" Redding, picks him as the new recruit. The first part of the film deals with Andy, Red and their group of friends dealing with prison life.Andy wants to be a freeman. He regrets his past and wants to move on with a new life and memories. But the ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy. A corrupt warden, sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack. He has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red.After almost a two decade stay, in 1966, Andy Dufresne escapes the Shawshank prison by tunneling through the wall with a rock hammer worn down to the nub. He sets off to a new country for a new life and is later accompanied by his prison mate Red.Andy Duresne is a man of hope. He is a smart person and a loyal friend. The Shawshank Redemption is the journey of redemption of Andy and his fellow convicts. Redemption is found in many ways, by many characters, even by a bird named Jake. It's a story portraying the corruption and politics in a prison and the transformation of an investment banker to a smart con. It shows how the weak and innocent protagonist, who is often bullied and tortured during his early stay in prison, adapts and changes himself with the situation and out smarts the guards and warden to run away with their illegal money and starts a new life.Review By  Mayank Bhattacharya \n",

      "Anyone who has not watched this movie needs to. Morgan Freeman's role really defined my generation. His performance as \"Red\" was probably the best I've ever seen.I'm not a big Tim Robbins fan, in fact this role is the only one I like, maybe Bull Durham...but not on this level. Andy Dufrane, really makes the best of what would simply drive most of us to the brink of insanity. He did it because he found friends. Which did become his family.Andy was a difficult man to know, he was so smart so intelligent. Even Red his friend who was telling the story didn't really seem to understand him, at least until the end. I love it how Andy had to put himself into positions to make the prison is own. He got himself out of a bad situation by befriending his enemies, and then when the time was right, taking them out. While in their minds they were using Andy for their benefits, but Andy knew he used them...brilliant.These two friends in a sense had their own lives defined by their friendship. How many people can say that have ever had a friend like that? I hope that in the next 20 years my best friend, will have help define me.The best thing about this movie, is how simple they made it. \"Get Busy Livin' or get busy dyin.\" That in and of itself is advice we all need, especially when work or school seems to dictate our routines.My advice watch this movie. It is the best of the last 50 years. Period. \n",

      "I will start with a basic summary:This movie starts out with a banker(Tim Robbins) who supposedly killed his wife and her lover while drunk. This led to a conviction and prison sentence. Most of the story takes place in this prison, Shawshank. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are the main characters, who become best friends who use their friendship as a means to escape from the hell of prison and the devil in their warden. Tim (Andy), a brilliant man, manages to make a slightly better prison life for himself and his fellow inmates by helping out the warden with basic office things. However, this was not enough for him. He need to escape, and escape he did in the most spectacular way. Now, I will give my opinion on the film:This film is something that you should devote time to watching when you have no interruptions. Turn off your cellphone and unplug your home phone before watching it because the greatness of this film is something that shouldn't be interrupted. The story line is perfect. The acting is perfect. The characters are so deep and gripping. The setting is excellent. If you have money, I would definitely recommend that you buy this in blu-ray (if you have blu-ray player) and connect it to a surround sound system, because you will want to hear every spoken word, every fallen leaf, every gust of wind, every detail.This is one of about only 5 movies that I give a solid 10 stars. \n",

Every important move in this movie is described by Morgan and his voice is such a plus that it lift the movie to next level.In a scene, where the entrance of the prison tower was shown in the top angle, it shows the world in to which the prisoners are entering. It is a sample scene where the director relied on cameraman to convey the message instead of 10 line dialog.Everyone expects Morgan and Tim to become friends after all both of them are big actors. It is predictable. But the way the friendship develops is truly amazing screenplay.Many sub-plots, people with different attitude were shown in the movie. Not all of them are good people. But most of the characters are in transformation phase where they repent for their mistakes.Poetic scene ? Many scenes are there. But the one in which Morgan, Tim and others drink beer at the top of the roof of one of the building and the way Morgan narrates the scene.. Amazing...It contains a twist which is a ingredient for any thriller movie. Yet that brilliant scene is so subtle that everyone appreciate.Will there be any other movie in our life time where it can be simple yet be so powerful and heart touching ?.

The fact that I had not did put into question my claim to be a movie lover. Now that I have, I admit it serves me right to have been questioned so.It is a damn good movie for all the reasons everyone wrote in their reviews and why critics also raved about it. I have no excuse for not watching it before other than my prejudice toward any movie having to do with jails, the prison life etc..Halfway into the movie, I was not convinced my prejudice about movies dealing in any way with prison would change, but the acting was good enough to keep me going. I was very happy with the direction this movie took, especially with the ending. Not since \"The Birdman from Alcatraz\" and Escape from Alcatraz have I enjoyed a movie that has prison as the setting; I don't expect it will soon either since my phobia with that is not going away soon. Finally, having seen Shawshank, I can now have an intelligent conversation about movies with friends and acquaintances without risking admonition for my failing to see the movie.

      "A complete experience out of the box filled with the class of the Golden and Silver Age of Hollywood. Its music leaves one as entranced as at the end of an epic and its story line strikes one as odd as does the sight of originality in a commercial world. It makes sense that Shawshank did poorly at the box office in its initial run because its commercial appeal is perhaps not as much as was that of Forrest Gump or Lion King. But its brilliance outweighs both of those films and instantly grabs one and reels one in. Soothing narration by the Sidney Poitier of the late 20th century and the all around nice guy persona projected by Tim Robbins makes the film a high achiever any where and any time. Why this film wasn't sent in to Cannes escapes me. The best part about the film is that even after one has watched it and knows the complete story, it seems as if the entire story does not necessarily depend upon the ending or the climax, every scene stands out on its own. The pacing of the film was what struck me as particularly surprising. I never once felt that a scene had been accelerated or had been overly edited. The hand carved chess pieces, the acts of altruism, the escape and most of all, Marilyn Monroe elevate this film to anyone's BEST EVER list.

      "This wasn't the first prison movie I've seen. The ones I had seen before this consisted of gangs of criminals brutally murdering each other. Or it involved drug dealers who ran the prison, without the slightest sign of any law force slowing them down.This movie has those elements, but doesn't exploit them as many prison movies often do. There is no epic fight or riot scene in the end. That's what I enjoy about this movie. It's not about deranged dealers, psychotic killers, or blood thirsty rapist. There normal people (more or less) living in this world that many will never have to witness. (Be thankful for that.) I'm not really sure if this is a spoiler or not because it doesn't change much in the story, but Tim Robbins plays a man falsely accused of killing his wife and her lover. It was a misstep to make him innocent, as it would of made his character more 'real' to have made a mistake in his life that he deeply regrets, as Red has. Red, played by Morgan Freeman, is the actors best role to date, and he's had many great roles in his career. You sympathize with this character greatly and you actually come to care for his fate much more than you do Andy's (Robbins).Overall, I think this a wonderful film that is very well written (based off a great short story by the master of horror, Stephen King), well directed, perfectly acted, with a satisfying ending (though I can see how some can call it a typical 'Hollywood'ending).That being said, is classifying it number one on IMDb justice? No. I'd be more than happy with it in the top 100, but the fact is there are better films out there, some which aren't even in the top 250.

      "My gosh, where to begin with this movie.....practically everything was nailed, spot-on. The story is as compelling and ultimately uplifting as one will ever find in cinema -- from the very get-go we see Andy Dufresne in a courtroom, being sentenced to life in prison for the murder of two people. So instinctively, we believe this must be true -- after all the judge did rule him guilty, right? But over time Andy grows on us, until we learn of his actual innocence, and by the end of the movie one can't help but root him on in his pursuit of freedom. Tim Robbins is the perfect assignment to play Andy, as Robbins' lesser-known status as an actor (as opposed to Tom Hanks, who was considered for this role) eases his task of being the quiet, tranquil Andy who prefers to keep to his own business. Andy's easygoing yet pensive nature makes him the ideal protagonist, as he is an independent thinker yet he can peacefully interact with all others.His friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman) is the backbone of The Shawshank Redemption. Red, a contraband smuggler, may be different from Andy in almost all respects, but over the years Andy earns Red's respect through his acts of courage and selflessness. This movie teaches that title does not have to dictate behavior -- a man who is in prison can be as kind and generous as anyone outside of prison walls -- it all depends on how far you're willing to look into that man's heart. I also love the fact that the friendship of the two men heightens very gradually -- that seems far more realistic than the instant-friends that one often sees in all mediums of story telling. This one takes time to develop, creating a profundity in the relationship and contributing to one of the movie's themes (time). This theme teaches us how much things can change over time, and also lends to the purported notion that Andy and Red have been in prison for a very long time.Red's narration is one of the standout features of The Shawshank Redemption. It is both poignant and insightful, allowing us unlimited access to his mind, which makes our empathy for him so real. While in most other films we learn about characters only through dialogue, in this one Red divulges practically everything to us. His abandonment of hope and eventual love for Andy makes him a tragic figure that should pull at the heartstrings of all viewers. When we first see him attempt to receive parole in 1947, he seems to be no more than an unfeeling criminal. But by 1967 when he's trying to leave Shawshank Prison after 40 years of incarceration, we hang on every word of his memorable \"rehabilitated\" speech. And when he meets Andy on the beach in the final scene, and the two peacefully embrace with a hug as the camera fades away, it is hard to hold back tears of joy.A significant aspect of this film is its theme of institutionalization. We are made to scrutinize exactly what prison does to people. How does a man adapt to freedom again, once he has been released? All Brooks Hatlen could land was a job as a grocery bagger and a room in a halfway house. This inauspicious lifestyle, plus the insecurities of being away from familiar faces while among all the technological/social changes since the start of his 50-year sentence, overwhelmed Brooks, as we all saw in a speechlessly dramatic suicide scene. Red lived in much the same fear before he decided to take off and cross the border to visit Andy. So we're forced to ask ourselves: does even a finite prison sentence essentially end the free will of its recipient? Is it better to leave the inmate in prison in certain cases? This cuts deeply into the philosophy of society's legal system.But the overarching theme of The Shawshank Redemption is hope. Hope is a wonderful, vital virtue that should never be absent in any human heart. Andy echoes this through his audacious acts (be it offering financial advice to Hadley or playing classical music over the prison intercom (which is one of the finest scenes you will ever see in cinema)). He vocalizes his faith in hope to his inmates when he claims that his two weeks in solitary confinement were the \"easiest\" he'd ever done, all thanks to the music he kept in his head. He tells Red \"get busy living, or get busy dying\" and uses the death of Brooks as his evidence, much to Red's initial chagrin. Yes, Andy is built into an icon for hope in this movie, and that is what makes it so universally successful in its appeal. Hope can and should be adopted by every human being who graces the earth. This notion is expressed through Andy's entire struggle, as well as in Thomas Newman's incredible musical score for the film (which is so good it has been used in multiple movie trailers before to evoke emotional response). This precious lesson, told through a film in which literally everything is perfectly mastered, is what makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest films ever made. \n",

Great cinematography though, specially during some incredible shots, that of the whole jail population standing still, frozen in their places, hearing the two sopranos sing Mozart and the one of Andy standing in the rain, raising both arms to the skies, expressing the joy of being a free man again.The acting is excellent across the board, except for the kid, who labors too much to be likable. The atmosphere of the prison is suitably conveyed in the claustrophobic settings, from the hopelessly enclosed, barren, courtyard inside the high walls to the always menacing presence of the uniformed guards. Here those hovering presences are not mere decorations, part of the landscape, as in many prison movies, but true components of the brutal reality of the world behind bars. The mortal beating received by one of the newcomers, the first night, warns us that these guards are an active part of the plot, so we have to take them seriously, get used to see them as such.This is a superbly done production from any point of view. The pace is thoroughly sustained, its overall forward flow allowing for scenes of unmitigated violence fit the unfolding story as effortlessly as others more settled ones, without modifying the momentum, because there's always something, someone, anchoring them all to the essential thrust of the film; the best ex.: the contemplative faces of the convicts, seen in semi darkness, while Hadley beats the newcomer to death, which tells us this kind of incident is just part of their everyday lives, almost a routine occurrence.What makes SR lose points in my book is the unlikely in some crucial plot elements as the unrealistic in some scenes, developments, especially after Andy has escaped. The biggest plot hole of all, IMHO, is the fact that warden Norton should have ever trusted the management of his scam to a convicted criminal under his careand a double murderer at that, as Andy was for him anyway. Call me naive, but I don't think there's one single warden in the world dumb enough to do such a thing when he may have easy access to many experts in the outside--financial consultants, bankerswho would give him help, advice, as useful, or even better, as the one provided by a convict who could easily turn into a blackmailer. And what best proves this point is precisely what Andy says to Red when explaining how he organized the fraud--the false identity of Randall Stevens, the multiple bank accounts--when he gloats that \"It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail\". As Norton had to know at least as much about these matters, how could he have trusted in a man who not only had the ability to take the whole thing away from him, as the experienced banker he was, but who could also send someone by mail the story of the scam, as an insurance policy, in case things would get dangerous for him in the can? Norton had to know from the beginning he was engaging in a loser's game. If he eliminated Andy he risked losing forever contact with his hidden funds; and if he didn't, he'd be forever vulnerable to his blackmail. So it isn't surprising why Andy's so happy about the whole thing. The question is, how could have Norton been so stupid to think he had any control on the situation? Other plot holes concern Andy's escape. See, he crawls hundreds of yards inside a 2--feet sewage pipe and then everything--the stink of human waste above all--goes away as by charm, with a simple rainfall. He smells like roses again. And just hours later he's perfectly groomed, dressed, ready to visit every bank manager in surrounding towns to make the necessary withdraws. He doesn't even look tired, when he surely must haven't taken a wink in the last 24 hours, busy as he was trying to get away from the jail house. And how did he manage to reach the Mexican frontier safe and unmolested? didn't the authorities publish his mug shot in every newspaper, tacked it to the wall on every police station, bus stop, within a few hours of his evasion? That part of his odyssey seems to have occurred as by miracle or divine protection. Now, if I'm nagging about all these things is simply because this is drama--so I'm led to think from the beginningand drama is the genre towards which we are the least forgiving concerning the unrealistic or the unlikely. (In thrillers like Capricorn One or The Sting we close our eyes to the same things, as we understand the main purpose there is to thrill us).Other of the weakest elements in SR lies in some of its characters. I have nothing to say about Andy or Red--as Freeman plays here again his Ted to Eastwood's Munny anyway. Neither about Hadley which if he seems a bit exaggerated in his wickedness doesn't seem unrealistic for someone who has read Abbott's In the Belly of the Beast. But minor characters are obviously used for emotional manipulation, specially the rocker kid. About him, after Red's voice over says that \"everyone liked him\"--what else we could do? (Anyway this character was put there just to show us viewers that Andy was innocent after all, so he was safely disposed of after that. Curious thing, I was comfortable with the idea of leaving that kind of foggy. Uhh, you can take people out of the Code but...). And the same for the situation with the Sisters, which is left to degenerate, when all what Hadley had to do was to tell them to leave Andy alone.But above all, great narrative, great plot development. 9/10. \n",

      "Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. Its one of those movies where you just sit and reflect for a while after the final credits roll. Great plot, script, and acting. One of the best ever made. When Andy escaped at the end and screwed the warden over, my gosh, it does not get any better than that. It also has one of those twists in it where you think that one thing is going to happen and the completely opposite does. Near the end, when everyone thought that Andy was going to commit suicide and we all thought that he was going to be in the cell dead, he was gone, vanished. When the warden revealed the whole in the wall hidden by the poster I don't remember felling better for the outcome of a movie than I did at the end of this film. \n",

Overall this inspirational motion picture is definitely out of this world. In my opinion this Movie is thought-provoking and it touches your sole in many ways.Andy Dufresne who was unlawfully sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover, became great friends with 'Red' a convict who was an influential inmate inside the Shawshank prison, they became a surprising partnership inside Shawshank prison Night after night, day after day, Andy tried to adapt to prison life, however he realised he shouldn't be in this indescribable road to hell so thats where his plans begin.... \n",

      "This is now the 2,340th Review of this Title. However, I'm still writing it because this movie deserves to be written about. It really exceeds the 10/10 scale. An awe-inspiring story of hope, this is just one of those movies that you know you still want to watch in 20 years. The movie premise itself at first sight doesn't seem like it will be all that interesting. However, from the first minutes, you realize the superior writing, acting and cinematography unrivaled I would say by any other film I've seen. Throughout the movie, I find myself constantly connected to the characters, wishing that the warden would overcome his cold-hearted nature and concede to let our antagonist, Andy free from the torment that was The Shawshank Prison. I almost let out an audible sob when Tommy was shot. If you're looking for something to bring you up, to give you hope, you've come to the right place. This movie is probably the most soul-touching piece of two and half hour film out there, encompassing friendship, suffering, hope, and freedom. This movie is really what I believe that this should serve as the model for Hollywood. It's about time that they learn that for a movie to be good, it doesn't need excessive gore, or explosions on screen, or special effects, or sex scenes or any of what comes with the modern-day Hollywood production. This movie is pretty simple. Just men talking. If you haven't seen this movie yet, now the #1 movie on the IMDb leader boards, you don't know what you're missing. A must see for anybody and everybody of age. (10/10) \n",

      "Can a man find redemption if he truly repents for the crimes he'd committed? Can the human spirit triumph even in the darkest of places, like a prison? Is hope a dangerous thing? These are the questions you will be asking yourself after watching this Fillet Mignon of a film masterpiece. Based on the incredible writer Stephen King and directed by the diamond in the rough film director Frank Darabont, the Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies of all time, in my opinion. It's one of those movies that whenever it is on TV, I can't help but watch it from start to finish.The story is narrated by the soothing voice of Morgan Freeman, named Red. And he tells us of the time a new prisoner, Andy a former bank executive convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, came to the Shawshank Pennitentary. At first, Andy has a tough time adjusting to prison life, even getting beaten up a few times by the fellow thugs. But soon he finds his place doing the taxes of all the guards and the warden.There are so many good things about this film, I can barely think of all of them. The story in which it was based was indeed an enthralling one, Frank Darabont directed it and did a great job, not to mention the grade-A casting.I'm not sure what the main theme of this movie is, but if I had to guess, it would be about hope. And that hope cannot escape anyone, even those in positions where they feel like there is none. And that redemption is available for any man.I rate this movie a 10. I never considered giving it anything less. \n",

      "I've watched a number of movies during the years. I'm not sure whether that number is north of 500 but it's definitely close. No other movie has had the effect that Shawshank Redemption has on me every time I watch it.The movie describes the years in prison of Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins), a banker who is convicted for the murder of his wife. There he meets Red(Morgan Freeman), another convicted felon, who -like most movies featuring Morgan Freeman- is also the narrator of the movie.Throughout his years in prison, we watch Andy go from some prisoners' boxing bag, to prison's librarian, to prison guards' personal banker. We experience with him the pain, the frustration, the sorrow. Tim Robbins gives a magnificent performance opposite Morgan Freeman's Red, maybe the only role outshining Mandela in Invictus. I won't bother you with technical details about direction, cinematography and art direction. The All-Time Best Movie place here in IMDb is by it's own a testament of the excellence that is the Shawshank Redemption. Few (if any) movies will provide the viewer with such a feeling of catharsis by the end. I hope I haven't spoiled it. If you haven't already watched this masterpiece of a movie, rush to the nearest DVD store. Every human being able of watching a movie should watch this movie at least once.Cheers \n",

      "From the intro setting up the mood for the 1940s with If I didn't Care that strangely feels like Bioshock or Fallout from the other era defining themes such as the relevance of Rita Haywood from the 50s to Tommy Williams emulating the James Dean Rock' n Roll character to set the mood of the 60s. This is something that has not been addressed when reviewing this movie, how it seamlessly transfer from era to era is genius in itself. The camaraderie between Andy and Red is flawless and the viewer truly believes that these two are the leaders of Shawshank and are the best of friends. By leaders, just look at the scene where Heywood is about to be slit by Brooks and Andy and Red are notified right away to solve the problem; great scene symbolizing their importance to the group. The only flaw which keeps it from being a perfect 10 out 10 movie is that it suffers from the same stereotype that prison movies are littered with, and that is the inclusion of sodomites. I know that's what happens in prisons, but is just disgusting and cringe worthy seeing this on screen; however Shawshank Redemption implies what the Sisters do to Andy and never graphically show it on screen and that is the saving grace. That is why it only loses one point and not several, anyhow. The movie's message about hope is more heavily implied near the end though, how Andy never loses hope while Red is closer to being institutionalized. The line get busy living or get busy dying always sends chills down my spine because of its relevance when Andy says it when he knows that the system is absolutely corrupt when his only witness that could get him a new trial is killed so that Andy could keep laundering money for the warden. \n",

Sadly it had some predictable conversations and seemed to be just another Morgan Freeman's movie. It dares to almost offend our intelligence the fact that the prison officers didn't check that poster carefully one single time in twenty years. And I have two questions: was the American justice that weak back in 1994? Were the condemned all smart and good people as this movie portrayed?If it deserves to be at 1st spot here? Maybe.

It has some of the best plot twists of any movie I ever saw (spoilers), the biggest one perhaps being when they really make it seem like Andy killed himself, but then it is revealed that he escaped.

I can guarantee this will be one of your favorites as soon as you finish watching it, that's what happened for me. I love this movie, and I could watch it again and again.

Take nothing away from Tim Robbins; sometimes, that one acting performance defines a legend. And honestly, if you are reading this review without having watched the movie yet, ...well, Go get it!!

He had all the clues against him, and not a really convincing alibi. He made some friends in the prison, including his best friend, the guy who could get things(\"Red\"), and the director of the prison. Using his experience as a former banker, he helped the director of the prison to make lots of money corruptly.He helped the director in exchange for some favors. But the director didn't helped him when he most needed him, and, to make it worse, he killed the only witness who knew the guy that had really killed Andy's wife and her lover.What anybody expected is the end of this story, which I wont give away. I can only say that the hope Andy had for things to work out had materialized, and the good guys lived happy forever.Masterpiece. \n",

It is a movie about truth, justice, bravery, and prison rape (what more can one ask for!) Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make a perfect match for this film, and despite one or two moments of slow tension between Robbins and everyone else in the film, it is very deep, powerful,thought provoking, jaw dropping, eyes widening, and spine chilling from beginning to end. The only thing I don't understand is \"WHERE ARE THE WOMEN!?\" This film is 99.9999999...9999% men and only 0.0000000...0001% women (at the very beginning having sex) but that is seriously the only complaint one can make about this film, other than the fact that it is long and depressing. The ending is down right perfect, and I had found myself in awe when I saw Andy (Tim Robbins) crawl through a 500 yard sewage pipe only to come out the other side a free man. What makes me curious about the film is why haven't people noticed that he was carving a hole behind the posters? He had changed them occasionally, there must have been some time when someone walked by and noticed a hole in the wall. The film's realism sucks you in like a vacuum cleaner to the point where you feel like you are a prisoner in Shawshank just chilling with Freeman and the gang of prisoner who bet on which prisoner is gonna cry first. \n",

I didn't know how the whole story would go to an end. I still able to enjoy it. I made myself to see it again, and finally I understood why it had so hight rate on IMDb. The movie started with Andy. A bank director, whom was sued for killed his wife and a man. Police fought exhibit to charge him for committed a murder. Andy was sent to jail for lifetime. In prison Andy met Red and they learned each other and became friendly. Red was a black man. He had been in prison almost 20 years at the time Andy came.Inside Andy always wanted to free himself out of the prison. It wasn't him, whom committed that horrible murder. I fell sorry for Andy. He paid his life for someone else, but nobody believed, he was innocently. What I was so surprised, Andy on the first time at the prison had planned to get out. Hope always inside him. That gave him strong to keep his plan to 20 years. And finally he was out of the prison.Red was different. He admitted, he was a murder when he was young. He apologised for what he did and wished to be a free man just like a bird. But every time he had a conversation with the whole manager, he always got denied. It's made him to feel hopeless. At the last time Red almost gave up all the hope. He didn't want to waste his time anymore. His speech was so amazing, fully emotion. Red just wished to go back at the time when he committed a horrible crime. He wanted to tell the kid, that what he did was so wrong. But he coundn't, he didn't have a miracle to do so. This time he got approved.What I learned about this movie was Hope and Friendship. Like Andy said \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of thing, and no good thing ever died\".

      "I want to start out by letting everyone know: I read Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption first, this may change the views I have towards the film (though not by much, but we'll get to that later).Shawshank Redemption is by far the best emotional roller-coaster that I've ever been on. I laughed some, I cried some, and I felt a genuine love for the characters and their struggle. In some ways, I want to say this is the greatest film ever but then I think about it, it's not the greatest film. There is a lot about it that makes it fantastic, some elements have the potential to be \"The greatest\". Here's the thing though: it's not the greatest movie I've ever seen, I just can't find anything that I dislike about it. This may not make a whole lot of sense, but think of it this way: for a very long time my favorite movie was Pulp Fiction (Tarantino), the raw feeling I got after watching Pulp was so new to me that I couldn't help but stand up and say \"That was the greatest movie I've ever seen.\" Immediately my friend disagreed with me, but Pulp just worked for me. I watched Shawshank with this same friend, and we had a discussion about how we felt about it. I didn't feel the raw emotion that I felt after Pulp, he agreed, but I also told him I thought it was excellent, he agreed. What he told me after that was: \"You know, I can see how it's the number 1 movie on IMDb, there's almost nothing to complain about, so there are fewer people who are going to hate it.\" He was absolutely right, there's just nothing to complain about.Now to the cast: Robbins and Freeman play a fantastic duo, (Freeman was a great choice for Red, even though Red is described as Irish, for real, in the novella) and like always Freeman plays his best. I'm not too acquainted with Robbins, but he did everything right, and he made Andy Dufrense a likable, but mysterious and distant character that Dufrense is. Freeman plays Red fantastically, flat out amazing, the nonchalance and joking nature of Red is captured perfectly by Freeman. The rest of the cast does very well, especially James Whitmore, who plays Brooks, the oldest convict in Shawshank State Prison. His role is one of the few in all of history that's brought me to tears.Seeing how there's no action, there's not much to talk about in the effects department, so I'll move on, straight to the story. I have a theory that Stephen King is not a good writer, at least I don't think so, but he is a fantastic storyteller. Shawshank is no different, the plot unfolds well, few details are missed, and the pace is perfect: not too fast, not too slow. I think a lot of the credit there goes to Darabont though, he did a fantastic job bringing an often under looked Stephen King novella to life, and I have no complaints on his work.In my opinion there's not a whole lot to say regarding this film, it's fantastic, but you have to watch it to understand why. So, pick this one up, I think this a movie with a broad base, which is very hard to dislike, no matter if you turn your mind off and enjoy (it's still followable) or if you like to think about every detail. I highly recommend it. \n",

His wife was cheating on him and murdered during her affair. Andy befriends Red a fellow inmate. During their time in prison together they become best of friends. They work through their hardships together. Throughout their story this group of inmates lives an unordinary prison life. This is shown from drinking beer while tarring the roof to doing the officers taxes. This is a remarkable story of the ups and downs of prison life and the new people they become. Andy states that in his free life he was a law abiding man, but he had to come to jail to become a criminal. This is commented on when he begins laundering money for the warden. Towards the end the camera shows Andy slumped on the ground leaning up against the prison, which is very neat. This view is from far away up above and gives the feeling of Andy being rather small. This is an amazing angle as it helps show how he is confused about escaping because he will miss his friends. The lighting throughout this movie allows us to see everything appropriately, but helps to set the mood of each scene. This can be seen when Andy is in the movie room about to be attacked the lighting is very dark. This is just one example of the many great lighting choices. This has been my favorite movie for a long time. This movie allows the viewer to look into the men's hearts and minds. Perhaps one of the classic themes to this movie is the narration throughout the movie that is performed by Morgan Freeman.

I know I have seen it more than 50 times and it never gets old. The film is a heart-wrenching tale of a falsely accused man forced to do a life term in prison due to an ironic twist of fate. Along the way, Andy makes friends amongst his fellow prison mates; as well as some friends in higher places. These friendships greatly influence the plot and outcome of the story. The film has a dark side, too as the brutalities of everyday prison life come to the forefront. Also, the film possesses a lighter side with its portrayal of hope and faith and how those traits can rise out of desperation. This film is a must see, and anyone who watches it will undoubtedly laugh, cry, and wonder as they follow the trials and tribulations of Andy Defresne and his close circle of friends as they experience life behind bars inside the deep, dark, and dank Shawshank Prison. \n",

In it's first, and elegants scenes, we see Andy Dufresne finding his wife and her lover dead, and then Andy being falsely Accused of murder and sentenced to prison. This first scenes although great, are not very important to the movie, because the movie does not turns around Andy's false accusation (We know that since the beginning), it's about what he learns and teaches inside the prison. Although Robbins's performance is not excellent, he gives the character an air of sadness, and in almost every scene of the picture, we can see through his expressions that he is always either angry because he is not supposed to be there, or upset because he can't find a way out of there. Despite the fact that this movie is not very original, and when I say that I'm remembering that it took a lot of elements from Don Siegel's \"Scape from Alcatraz\" (I mean, it can be coincidence, but don't you think that Brooks's raven is very is very similar in the story to the mouse of \"Scape from Alcatraz?), the movie covers it because it's always grabbing you on the screen , I mean, there wasn't a single moment in the whole movie that I thought was boring.Verdict: With a powerful moving story, charismatic characters (Especially Freeman's), this Excellent movie is a great study of agony and friendship. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is one of those one in a million type of films. The story is simple; innocent man gets falsely accused of murdering his wife, goes to prison for 20 years, escapes. You can't get any simpler than that, but that is the beauty of it. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman had their best roles in this film, and without a doubt Oscar worthy. The twists and turns, confrontations, inspirations, and most of all, hope make The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest films of all time. You can't help but smile at the end of the film, and maybe even shed a tear, but in any case The Shawshank Redemption is worth the watch over any other movie, and I encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to see it as soon as possible. There will never be another film like this, but nevertheless, Shawshank will never be forgotten and will go down in history as being the most uplifting film ever. \n",

      "9.0Living in today's time, you might find yourself to be incredibly busy. Or you might find yourself to have nothing but time. Lots of time, and nothing to do. you might feel pressured in by tasks and responsibilities. Jobs, school, family, children, or other obligations/duties. You might feel like you want to escape, even if for a little bit. Even if for just 2 hours. So you head over to the theater. You can catch a 2 hour flick and for those 2 hours, take your mind off the day's and the next day's demands. It can be quite adventurous, if you're seeking that. Or even emotionally gratifying. Truth is, films, and other entertainment, offer escapism. And the producers and creators of these films know this. So, why watch a movie about imprisonment? You might find the subject interesting, if you're keeping in mind that you will most likely never go to prison. So why not watch from the outside, from the other side of the glass mirror. You're safe there, and the film on screen cannot hurt you. The villains or dangers on screen cannot attack you, let alone even perceive you. But the opposite is true. The creators of the films know you are there. You are the reason why the film exists. And they aim to affect you. They sometimes even aim to attack you. And they definitely can. Have you ever watched a movie that \"spoke to you\", made you feel something, maybe even made you cry? How could you cry over nonexistent people? How can these nonexistent people affect you? It's because films are a reflection of the world. This reflection, although often exaggerated (sometimes super exaggerated), strike a chord in you. And the music, or the movie, stays in your head. And in your heart.So, once again, why watch a movie about imprisonment? Why would you escape to a place where people want to escape from? You're going into it with the assumption that at the end, the villain is defeated (the villain being the prison), and the characters, which you've somehow come to relate to and care about in the brief hour or two that you've known them, triumph over the villain and escape danger. And admittedly, as exaggerated as that is, you need it. A person does not suffer for no reason. One does not fall to stay down. And besides, who's to say that life inside is not life at all?The Shawshank Redemption is a human tale. It is one of the most down to earth films I've ever seen. Human emotion, thought and spirit is painted onto the screen, while succeeding at using the medium of film for storytelling, resulting in a powerful and well composed movie. The human heart is exposed as a fragile, yet firm organ which endures pain, and even worse, sorrow. It is a pillar of integrity that continues to beat even when the spirit of the person is broken, and hope itself has been lost and forgotten about. However, while the story, pacing and performances will draw you in and not let you go with its stroke of humanity, the film also displays the human being at its worst. Complete disregard for the well being of others, lack of forgiveness and greed are personalities and behaviors that are exhibited in the film. The truth is, mankind is not fit for self judgment. This is exhibited by errors in trial and the need for juries and witnesses. However, it is also fact that the men serving life sentences, although some committed errors whilst in a certain drunken state of mind, are insane.Although there are many faces in The Shawshank Redemption, and some come as far as to redeem themselves a little bit from time to time, there is one character that is static throughout all the film: the prison. It is arguably the best character, giving the best performance as well. There are several shots in the film that display the prison, that are the best shots in the film. This is the core of the film. This is where the atmosphere and tone of the film shine through, albeit gloomy. I just wish that there were more shots of the prison throughout the film. But it is not the main character of the film. While it is a character that speaks to the audience, it is not a relatable character.The Shawshank Redemption is a fine, fine film. It unveils the human heart, and all the wonders and beauties that it is capable of. It also manages to show off the polarity of the human heart. How men are capable of not just ending life, but installing factors like misery, sorrow, and hopelessness in others. Why do we feel trapped at times? Who's keeping you in, and what are they keeping you from? The Shawshank Redemption is a film that will imprison you, and not let you go until it has affected you. And when it finally has affected you, it will set you free. Blue skies, green grass and white clouds are what surrounds us every day. Sometimes we spend too much time in \"the hole\", and forget what life is like out there. You may even get used to it, and find yourself feeling like you can't survive on the outside. You may find yourself living in fear out there. But the truth is, you can build brick walls around a man, impose limitations to his actions and goals, but a man is only trapped on the inside. And just like our character Andy Dufresne, we had to come to prison to become a crook. So, \"get busy living, or get busy dying.\" And get busy watching The Shawshank Redemption. \n",

      "****Contains spoiler****I love the movie because it portrays great characters!As to my favorite character, Since all the characters in this movie are so unique and vivid, especially Red and Andy, I had been in a tough time to pick out my most favorite one. For God's sake, let me just elect Andy at random first and write about the others next time. I think that the attraction for Andy mainly comes from the diversity between his exterior and interior. I have got to tell you that just Andy's appearance can merely teach me a lesson, reminding me of a saying, \"never judge a book by its cover. \" I cannot describe it better than those who have met Andy, so let me quote some words from them：1. \"My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know. Like a closed book\". - Stated by Andy, himself\"You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. It chills my blood just to look at you.\" -- Cited from the Judge who sentenced AndyTommy: \"What's he in here for anyway?\" Red: \"Murder.\" Tommy: \"The hell, you say.\" Red: \"You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.\" -- Cited from the conversation between Tommy and Red (Red had contacted with Andy more than 30 years when he said that )The above quotes may show that Andy is a fierce , cruel man in the external appearance. While he is warm-hearted and even be ready to help out. Andy made the government to expend the library to educate far more prisoners. Besides he even help a couple of fellas to get their high school equivalency. 2. \"I admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over. That was my first impression of the man.\" --cited from RedAccording to Red's comment, Andy looks weak, while you can find out that he is pretty brave. In the prison, Andy had been targeted by a group of homosexual guys called The Sisters. nevertheless Andy never gave in to them, even though he was beaten to dead by The Sisters.3. Andy is an extremely intelligent person, who is a banker and educated man. He always know the way to survive. In the person, one cannot live on his own, he has to gang up with others. He bought the gang beers and get accustomed to the custom of prison. Andy get along with the guards even the warden as well by helping them to earn extra money by finding the tax-deductible part.4. \"He had a quiet way about him...a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled...like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world. Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.\" -- Cited from RedAndy is always in a clam mood and plans things to accomplish with a very rational and organized way. Although Andy is flesh and blood, he is still patience and can tolerate everything regardless of all the abuse and bully. He spent 20 whole years for his prison-break with no single shred of sign or evidence.5.Andy is the type of person who appreciates help and gives his brutal revenge to the bad and evil. Tit for tat is a great conclusion to his personality. He exploded the bribery and even murder crime that the warden had committed, a doomsday to the evil once and for all.Considering all the points above, that is why I appreciate the character Andy. \n",

      "Words of praise can't do enough justice for this film. There's something about it where you could watch it over and over and over and know everything that's gonna happen and still be shocked, saddened, and amazed by it as if you saw it for the first time. It just screams perfection: perfect story, acting, themes that are greatly worked into it without being too obvious. Part of the reason this is one of my favorites, maybe even my overall favorite film, is that it touches on so many world-essential things that everyone can relate to: hope, faith, integrity, justice, and the will to live and survive to name a few. I was shocked when I learned that this didn't win any Oscars. Although I do love Forrest Gump (the big winner of '94 which beat Shawshank for pretty much everything it was nominated in) and think that Tom Hanks did a brilliant job as Forrest, I still feel that Shawshank was slightly better. Morgan Freeman delivers what might be the performance of his career. There's so much believability in that it's just amazing. Tim Robbins is probably the only man who could have played Andy so perfectly. His quiet demeanor evokes great wonder about him, much like how Roy Orbison is such a presence on-stage and he hardly even moves. But the thing to really marvel about Andy is his integrity and patience. Although his need to escape could have driven him insane, his hope and faith in justice and God kept him sane enough to patiently work out his escape for 19 years. That meeting between Red and Andy where they discuss hope has to be one of the greatest scenes in the whole movie, next to Andy's \"resurrection\" baptism in the rain and when he breaks the sewage pipe with the stone in sync with the lightning. This film is much like another favorite of mine \"Citizen Kane\" because when it first came out people didn't really understand it that well and didn't see the prophetic power in it the first time around. But nowadays we as viewers have realized the impact and power that Shawshank holds on everyone who sees it. Every time it rains now, I just have the urge to run outside, take my shirt off, and just feel the rain pour down on me. I've seen this film maybe 10 times by now, and I know that I'll never stop watching it until the day that I die. \n",

      "First off... I really liked \"The Shawshank Redemption\".It's a movie that is comfortable with itself,it knows exactly what it is - a good prison story with excellent performance from the leads and a happy ending.It was never intended to be a cult masterpiece,that status has become an \"aftermarket accessory\",so to speak. With only a \"so - so\" initial reaction nobody concerned could have imagined it would be elevated to the pantheon of movie greats. I suspect that in a world desperate for good to be recognised and evil punished,a world where the small man was becoming increasing powerless against \"Them\",heroes like Andy and Red,abundantly decent and \"ordinary\" raged against the machine on the audience's behalf. Movies about good vs evil whether \"Star Wars\", \"Lord of the Rings\" or the later \"Harry Potter\" series have built huge followings largely on that basis. Mr King's original novella could not have produced such an affect,it needed a movie with all its immediacy and impact to open out his story and punch his message to the audience. Whilst a book may be put aside and continued later,thus weakening its affect,a movie is seen in its entirety in a relatively short space of time - no distractions. There has always one small thing that has bothered me for years.... How did Andy hang his poster of Rita Hayworth back up covering the hole in his cell wall after he had escaped? That apart,\"The Shawshank Redemption\"is a completely satisfying prison story,bringing up to date the old George Raft,James Cagney movies from the 30s and 40s. Many people,for whom it has a special message,think it amongst the finest films ever made. \n",

      "Great films stir emotions. They have an impact that lasts long beyond the trip to the cinema. They give you an opportunity to reflect on your life, to ponder on the moments and they can inspire. The often misnamed 'Shawshank Redemption' (Scrimshaw Reduction?) was a box office failure when it came out in the UK in 1995. It's a story about 2 men, in prison in the 1940s, 50s and 60s and what happens to them... and that sounds pretty dull. But actually there is a simple message to this film and that is that hope is a good thing and nothing good ever dies. It's about the harsh and violent injustices that beset the central character including one of my personal greatest fears  being locked up for something I didn't do. The enigmatic Andy Dufresne goes on a 20 year journey of triumph in the face of adversity  a metaphorical and literal crawl through **** There are some powerful messages at play: that we can all become institutionalised in jobs or relationships, but that if we stick with them and believe in ourselves we will get to where we are aiming in the end. My passion for this film is that it is about life changing friendships and bonds between men which we quite often find difficult to express. It leaves a lump in the throat every time. Having seen it with my girlfriend, I went to see it two days later with my best friend and when it came out on video I rented it and watched it with my dad. It's a life affirmation film and when I'm fed up it never fails to give me the reminder that \"sometimes it all comes down to a simple choice  get busy living or get busy dying.\" In my humble opinion, this is the greatest film of all time. \n",

I can still remember the letter that he was narrating while it played out. Very nicely done. There are many memorable lines throughout this movie, many of which deal with hope which is a nice thing to hear about.

      "Adapted from a Stephen King novella, The Shawshank Redemption takes a prison drama and twists it into a fascinating existential treatise on how to approach the business of day-to-day life in the face of a desperately Sisyphian reality. As the film's signature line suggests, \"Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'.\" Filmed on location in an Ohio prison, the film occasionally lapses into familiar formulas and well-known stereotypes of the prison-drama genre, but overcomes them due in no small part to a pair of transcendent performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Director Frank Darabont and cinematographer Roger Deakins (a Coen brothers collaborator) recreate the drudgery and hopelessness of prison life in both the look and the details of dreary rituals of daily life. Spanning twenty years in the lives of its protagonists, Darabont's screenplay and direction allow us the luxury of getting to know these men -- hardened criminals, with little hope for the future -- through a series of quietly captivating scenes that slowly build atmosphere and tension without sacrificing characterization and thematic integrity. A critical success but a box office failure when it was first released, the film was nominated for seven Oscars, but won nary a one. Only when Shawshank was released on video did it steadily garner full-fledged public reverence. \n",

      "With the many other entries already here, I won't bore the reader with another synopsis. But hopefully, I will provide the details of one scene that sticks out so greatly in my memory because of the unbelievable (and fantastic) attention to detail that is not only here but is gloriously throughout this whole movie.Towards the end, Red (Morgan Freeman) is searching for something that Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) left for him. Red has been paroled but the possibility still exists that he will either kill himself like Brooks or commit a crime just to get back into the safety of prison. His day job (bag boy at a local grocery store) is going nowhere.Months (possibly years) before, Andy gave Red directions on finding something very important if Red ever got out of prison. Red finally with nothing else left to do, follows up on that request. He travels a fairly long way (for him), across some difficult terrain and comes upon the scene described. Yet, it still requires searching and faith to uncover what Andy has left him.Finally, he finds it, and opens the contents, and his life is changed forever.What is so important is the minute detail of this scene  the location is not next to some superhighway but far off the most unbeaten path one could imagine. The object is not carelessly left under one rock, but under a number. Many people would have assumed they were in the wrong place after a few minutes of not finding the object and moved on.Finally, when Red does find it, he looks very furtively around him sure that someone must be watching him. He sits down, now practically hidden from any possible passers-by, and opens the object, and what he finds inside leads him to even more frightenedly glance around, sure now that there must be others watching, he must be found out, HE MUST STILL BE IN PRISON.This whole scene could have been done it about two minutes, a couple of quick cuts, him opening the box and discovering the contents and then a cut to the next scene. But, it isn't that at all, it is one of the most intricate scenes I have ever witnessed for what is a small advancement of the plot. But that's the catch. This is so important to the plot, that the scene had to be given this kind of detail, so that the viewer would completely understand what Andy was talking about and what Red had to discover. Red for all practical purposes was still in prison  and he wasn't living yet, he was still getting busy dying.At this moment in the movie, Red (and you the viewer) still doesn't know if Andy made it on the outside. He escaped, but where to? Yes there was that (more or less) cryptic postcard, but especially how did whatever Andy left for Red figure into the story? When would Andy have buried it? How did he know what to put inside it? Considering the search underway for Andy on the day following his escape, if I were Andy, as soon as I recovered the money from the banks, I would have been long gone, far, far out of the state of Maine. I certainly wouldn't want the warden walking into any of the banks and finding me there, and it would have taken several days for the newspaper to decide to publish the article and especially for the State Corrections officials to come down on the warden even with all the incriminating evidence. Andy needed to be gone for several months until all the hoopla had died down before he could return to actually bury the object. So, the intricacy of this scene now becomes clear as it really has to match the intricacy of Andy's planning for every detail This whole sequence is so important to the story, because it's now time for Red to decide if he should get busy dying or get busy living, because he now finally has the choice. Maybe this movie is more about Red's growth then about Andy's resilience. Andy always had his drive, Red needed to learn it. Andy gave him the courage to finally face his own demons and overcome them. Red now has his chance at redemption. Remember, Andy didn't commit any crimes, Red did. Andy really didn't need to be redeemed - Red needed it badly, The performances by Tim Robbins, especially when he tells Red of his request and Red imagines the worst, and of Morgan Freeman in this little scene are spectacular. I cannot possibly imagine any other actors pulling this off. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie. You can tell it is a great movie from the very beginning. Unlike many movies of the same type, the main character gets away, and the main villain gets what was coming too him. The Scene where Andy escapes is one of those scenes that will stick with you for a long time. It is without a doubt one of my favorite movie scenes. The way he is just stripping his clothes and throwing them on the ground, it really gives you a since for how emotional a moment it is for him. When he looks up at the sky, it just makes you want to cry. Hey that rhymed. Anyway, everyone should see this movie. \n",

I have watched it maybe twenty times, its always an inspiration and an excellent tonic for those of us living a life we would like to change.The lines and the narration at the end are like poetry and the message of hope and human defiance is transcended to all.

The film contains something for everyone, there's sorrow, friendship, violence my main complaint was that there were a few elements I did not understand, particularly in the scenes that regard the accountancy work that the main character engages in.The acting was unforgettable, Tim Robbins deserves credit as the main seemingly devoid of all feelings, yet with that certain characteristic about him, Morgan Freeman as usual shines through as the man who can 'get things' and my personal favourite Clancy Brown as the sadistic hard ass security captain.I recommend that everyone see this movie at least once, it is without a doubt one of the great classics of our time. \n",

      "This movie is absolute perfection. The story is about a bank teller, Andy, (Robbins)who is wrongfully imprisoned for life for the murder of his wife and her lover. In prison, Red (Freeman) becomes his best friend. The movie progresses by showing the life that Andy has to endure in prison. For example, he becomes a prime target by a few homicidal sodomites and obviously has to fight them off, which ends with him in the infirmary.The movie is excellent because it shows a very accurate portrayal of prison life, and the corruption within the prison by the blood thirsty power crazed guards, and the so called religious and honest warden, who is really a greedy sadistic manipulator who takes advantage of Andy by forcing him to do his taxes and make him work to make him rich.This movie may very bell be the best movie you ever see.

Andy Drufesne (pronounced Dufrene; and played by Tim Robbins (Bull Durham)), the vice president of a large Portland, Maine bank, is given a life sentence in Shawshank Prison after he is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, run by religious Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and sadistic Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown). He befriends fellow prisoner Red (Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy)). Over a few decades, Andy befriends the inmates, begins a library, education system and work program. But Andy is innocent, and has trouble convincing the authorities of that, and the film works up to the inspirational and excellent climax.Robbins and Freeman blend into their roles like chameleons, and the script is well written.I will sum up the review in this one statement: go see it.You will not be disappointed. \n",

When I am depressed, I watch this movie, and there is not a single time I have not felt good.From the very first scene, with a drunk and disturbed Andy, to the last scene, with a free and relieved Andy - I enjoy all the moments. You don't watch some movies, but you start feeling them, and believe me, it is one of them. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are exceedingly good in this movies and so is the storyline. Some of the best moments of the movie are - Andy winning beer for his co-workers (yes, Andy refers to his prison mates as co-workers), Andy resisting the violent advancements from the homosexual prisoners and getting beaten up each time but still never giving up, Andy playing the music record without giving an ear to the warden, Brooks struggling to live his post-prison life and finally committing suicide, the warden madly asking the poster about Andy and finally discovering the tunnel, Red getting the parole approved, Red finding the stone and Andy's stuffs and above all, Morgan Freeman's narration. The script of the narration is brilliant and Morgan Freeman's baritone gives it the needed effect.If you love true cinema, this is a movie for you. If you have not watched it, do it now!!!

He is treated poorly as a lot of prisoners are but he forms bonds with other inmates, especially an inmate named Red. From within the prison Andy helps with the formation of a library and helps others with money woes. There are good positive things in this movie but for the most part, it is a dark and cruel movie. It has a certain sadness that brings about it's greatness. The most important thing about this movie are the friendships that develop within a dark place.

The \"do over\" happens when the kids can't agree on exactly how legal a play was, whether there was a penalty, or what exactly happened. That particular play is forgotten and the game proceeds. This film is about a life \"do over\".By all measures Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) was successful: he was a banker, married to a beautiful wife, and living in a pleasant home. When his wife is murdered, he is convicted and sent to prison. While not guilty of murder, he convicts himself for neglecting his wife and - it is hinted - his privileged life. Prison forms the environment for even harsher penalties for this crime. Ironically in his endurance Andy finds a deeper appreciation for simpler things: friendship, opera arias, and a cold beer after hard work on a hot day.Red (Morgan Freeman) is also serving a life sentence for murder. He slowly becomes Andy's best friend. Red is the prison's unofficial retailer and a peerless guide for Andy in survival. It is through Red that Andy gathers a close ring of friends.Andy's hope is born from the prison warden's avarice and hypocrisy. Using his banking skills Andy is able to reward the warden's greed and his friends. Andy organizes a prison library where Red and his circle work.Andy realizes he must act after the Warden reveals the full extent of his insatiably evil appetite by murdering the only person who could prove his innocence.This is a long movie but like all great movies that isn't noticed. While it is guilty of being in the common genre of prison movies and having the sort of clichéd ending for which Hollywood is canonized, lionized, cursed and scandalized, the true measure of this movie is that it still delivers a potent story.

It's about friendship and loss, full of emotion, irony, humor and nostalgia. All wrapped around one hell of a satisfying plot twist and revenge sequence against the story's antagonists you'll probably ever see.The icing on this scrumptious cake is one hell of a divine original scoring from composer Thomas Newman, the man who scored The Green Mile and American Beauty. It is haunting and often very moving. I realize that for many people one small segment of music in even a great film isn't enough to invoke a desire to watch the entire film. However there is a approximately 10 second segment of the score near the end of the film that will break your heart. You'll know which segment I mean if you see this film and if you're the right kind of person with a good soul, it will move you to tears. Somehow the movie manages to pull off an epic feel despite the backdrop being prison bars and walls.

      "Far and away, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" deserved, with every fiber of its being, to win the Best Picture Oscar for 1994. Morgan Freeman, who, until \"Million Dollar Baby,\" had been robbed of an Oscar for films such as \"Driving Miss Daisy,\" had his pinnacle performance for \"TSR.\" Beautifully crafted, totally captivating, and flowing effortlessly with Freeman's narration, \"TSR,\" for all its gray colors, paints an exuberant portrait of life behind bars--the wrongly convicted Andy Dufrane (Tim Robbins) adapts to prison life, all the while calculating an escape that spans three decades. Keeping his friends close, and enemies closer, Dufrane takes a seemingly innocent hobby and turns it into a redemption that takes him to Mexico, with Red (Freeman) serving his time and following suit.If there is a film that speaks more to the believer in all of us, I haven't encountered it yet. It doesn't matter what hour of the evening, or what mood I'm in, if \"TSR\" is playing...I'm watching, and loving it just as much as the first time around.It's been fourteen years...if you haven't seen it, ask yourself, \"What the hell's wrong with me?\" \n",

This movie shows you what some prisons can be like in some places at different points in time.

Even Roger Ebert is guilty of this. So, because of bad information I usually wait for the DVD to come out and that's too bad because I'm denying a good movie some money it could use in it's theatrical release.

What makes this film so special (asside from the excellent acting from both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins) is the message of hope, even in your darkest hours. Robbins plays a man sent to jail for a crime he did not commit--the murder of his wife and her lover. He is found guilty, and sent to Shawshank Penitentiary. He meets Freeman, who has spent most of his life in Shawshank for a crime he committed when he was a young, dumb kid. Freeman feels that Robbins wouldn't last past his first night in prison. But after being repeatedly sodomized by \"the sisters\" and manipulated by the warden, Robbins remains resilient and hopeful. He gains Freeman's respect as well as his friendship. The men go through three decades of unhappiness as the pinup on Robbin's wall changes from Rita Hayworth to Marilyn Monroe to Racquel Welsch. Each one hiding a secret that grows bigger, with time. Something that Robbins doesn't even confide in his best friend Freeman.After one final betrayal from the warden, we find out what those posters were hiding...The gateway to Robbins' freedom.

      "Back in 1994, 'The Shawshank Redemption' opened to lukewarm reviews and mild economic success, securing less than $30 million at the domestic box office. Though nominated for a very respectable seven Academy Awards, it failed to win any of these, up against the likes of 'Forrest Gump' and 'Pulp Fiction.' Since then, the film has steadily grown in popularity and now stands as one of the most highly-regarded films of the 1990's.Convicted for the brutal murder of his wife and her lover, a crime of which he claims to be innocent, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins, 'Mystic River,' 2003) is ordered to serve two back-to-back life sentences at Shawshank Prison. Life is hard. The prison guards are brutal and unforgiving, many prisoners are ruthlessly antagonistic towards Andy, and the warden is greedy and corrupt. Nevertheless, Andy forms lifelong friendships with many of his fellow prisoners, most particularly Red (Morgan Freeman, 'Se7en,' 1995), the \"man who can get things.\" Clinging stubbornly to the knowledge of his own innocence, Andy never loses his hope that justice will inevitably prevail. Despite being a story filled with suffering and adversity, 'The Shawshank Redemption' remains one of the most uplifting and inspirational films of all time. \n",

      "I watched \"The Shawshank Redemption\" last night with my husband, partly to see what the fuss was all about. I found it a well made moving film, but a little too sentimental. Red's character was complex. He was very noble (well, he is played by Morgan Freeman) but he was in prison for being a murderer, and the speech he made to the parole board at the end of the film showed his dilemmas and the darker side of his personality. Andy was complex too as the other prisoners saw. I thought the characters were too clichéd in the way that the warden and the guards were bad, the prisoners were good, except for a group of prisoners (the Sisters) who were bad. Aside from Andy and Red, the characters fit clearly on one side of the good/bad divide. I would have liked to see more sides of their personalities. The film delivers some surprises by the end: it was wonderful not to have any inkling of Andy's escape, his plans for revenge, or his gift to Red, providing Red with his freedom. The script develops the story skillfully and makes the audience care deeply about the prisoners, not just Andy and Red. I would have liked to know what happened to the prisoners after the corrupt warden and the bullying guards were arrested. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" tells a powerful story well, but it would have an even more powerful punch if it allowed more time to discover the prisoners' inner natures: the darker tone of the \"fishing\" scenes at the start really isn't returned to. I loved Banks' pet crow and the nod to \"Birdman of Alcatraz\". That film was a strong portrait of both the Birdman and the experience of being in a prison. Ultimately, I didn't feel that \"The Shawshank Redemption\" gives a picture of what it's like to be a prisoner locked away in a corrupt institution for decades. For one thing, I can't see an entire population of a prison reacting to Mozart on the loudspeaker with awe: surely there must have been more prisoners who prefer Hank Williams. \n",

      "Shawshank Redemption is one of the most insightful and thought provoking movies I have seen. With the character \"Red's\" narration, it comes across a little like a documentary because of the details of prison life presented. But we are being told a story in such a way as to keep us interested enough to hear the outcome.I view the character, Andy (at least later in the movie) as an undetected mouse in a board meeting or fly on the wall who observes more than the average person. Red describes him as wearing some kind of cloak that shields him from the effects of the prison. This is revealed as hope later on. Andy somehow refuses to allow his hope to be crushed or snuffed out.He accomplishes so much during his incarceration, much of it due to his undaunted perseverance and redirected energy. It is brilliant and insanely brave when he asks the guard if he trusts his wife. Pushed to the brink of destruction, he barely gets the words out to the effect that the guard can keep all of the inheritance if he gifts it to his wife.The story reminds me of the Biblical Joseph in an Egyptian prison, a documented instance of undeserved confinement.The spoiler that I have for those already initiated is: Andy places his own copy of the Bible in the warden's safe the evening of his planned escape. The warden is mocked when he reads his own quote to Andy inside the cover and the hollow for the pick-ax is revealed. I wonder if Andy's routine included locking up the warden's Bible, or was this a one time sting for the warden's sake? \n",

      "I wrote my first review of this movie back in 2006. I feel I did not do it the justice it deserved.I grew up in Mansfield, OH, not very far at all from the Ohio State Reformatory. The old \"castle Dracula\" Administration building is all that is left now. A new prison (Mansfield Correctional Institution) was built on the site where the other buildings existed along OH-13. I remember the impending demolition just waiting for this movie to finish filming......Thank God it waited! The story begins in 1946 when Portland banker Andy Dufresne is tried for and wrongfully convicted of the double murder of his wife and her \"lover\".Andy arrives at Shawshank state prison in early 1947 and is greeted harshly by ruthless authority and by thugs who seem to enjoy beating him up. Andy keeps strong and keeps very much to himself for the first two years.Andy finally decides he needs a hobby to keep his mind occupied. He approaches the well known prison entrepenour, \"Red\", and asks if Red might smuggle something into the prison for him... This kick starts the relationship between Red and Andy that the movie centers its attention on.There is a gentle tug of war between the two regarding ideals. Red, guilty of murder and sentenced to life with parole, sees no hope in existence outside of the prison walls. He tries, throughout the film, to convey to Andy that \"hope can drive a man insane\" and its best to just accept your fate. Opposites must attract because Andy was Red's polar opposite and it began to catch Red's attention. Andy would confront the police guard to ask for beers for his friends. He'd play music over the Shawshank PA system from the Warden's office. He'd write the state once or twice a week for years and years to get funds for a new library. Andy Dufresne dared to dream and he turned the negativity of Shawshank on its head...and just may have changed Red's view on things.The villain in the movie is Warden Norton. The Warden notices Andy's skills and intelligence early on and took full advantage. He entices Andy to be sort of an \"administrative assistant\". He started out in doing tax returns for the guards, which he was very good at. In time, the Warden enticed him to use his banking skills to mastermind a money laundering scheme that would make the Warden \"a millionaire when he retires\". Andy had to \"go to prison to be a crook\". This kept his mind occupied.About 2/3 the way through the film, a young kid is admitted to Shawshank who knows who killed Andy's wife 19 years before. Andy is ecstatic and he takes the news to the Warden. At risk of the money laundering scandel being brought to light, the Warden ensures Andy he's not leaving Shawshank. Andy gets two months in the hole. The young kid gets shot.Andy, the beacon of hope for this movie, decides HE WILL get out. And HE WILL get his freedom.We go back to Andy's first meeting with Red 19 years before the escape...the little chess piece chiseling 6\" rock hammer that he asked for... He'd been chipping away at the concrete wall in his room for 19 years and NOBODY SAW IT COMING.Andy busts out of that stinkin place, crawls through a 500 yard sanitary line and \"comes out clean on the other side\". Andy is gone and is free like a bird.Red, with his inspirational friend gone, does begin to lose that hope that Andy almost convinced him of. Life at the prison begins to suck. Red, after 40 years, gets paroled. He has no idea how to adapt on the outside. He might just commit suicide.Only one thing stops him...a promise he made to Andy... Determined, Red puts on his hat and suit, clamps his travel case shut. Give busy livin, or get busy dyin...thats god damn right. He bolts town and meets up with Andy on the beach in Mexico. Red, once a young crook, now redeemed old man. \n",

It makes you think of how good your life is when you get to be free.It is hard for me to put my feelings into words because \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is one of that kind of movies that makes you think. The movie has been very educating for me.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not an ordinary prison-movie. It is an epic story about friendship. I almost start to weep when I think of Red (outstanding Morgan Freeman) and Andy's (excellent Tim Robbins) strong relationship! In the film Tim Robbins' character, banker Andy Dufresne is being accused to have murdered his wife and his lover while they were having an intimate moment. The jury finds the defendant guilty as charged and Andy is sent to the infamous Shawshank prison which was known for its cruel punishments for misbehaving. While being a new meet in prison Andy is being harassed by the Sisters, inmates who want to taste some of that fresh meet. Everything happens on Red's point of view. Red is the guy who can get almost anything you want by smuggling stuff in. He is a provider who will someday give Andy the key; Rita Hayworth.The film is full of injustice but even if you are locked up you can find your soul-mates. Also after being imprisoned for a long time it will grow on you. It becomes your home. But not for Andy. He knows he's innocent. Maybe the Shawshank isn't so hard to crack...\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is based on a short story by no other than king of horror Stephen King. I have found his prison-movies to be very very good because, well, the pictures about his stories have always been little downbeat. Maybe because of the supernatural side, I guess. I have this short story on my bookshelf and it's almost as same as the movie. The only thing's that different in the short story is that Red was a ginger-haired, white Irishman. Freeman's Red is also Irish but we all know the difference. It doesn't make any difference, really.The lesson of this movie is to never give up hope. Life can sure kick you but kick back. Be smarter than life.\"I hope I can get across the border. I hope to see my friend, and shake his hand. I hope that the Pasific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope.\" -Red \n",

More about that later though, one of the movie's strongest aspects, the acting.Before watching this movie I had never heard of Tim Robbins, and after was left wondering why, the way he developed the character of Andrew Dufresne was incredible, why he hasn't been in many, many more big productions.But the real star in this Movie was Morgan Freeman,maybe it was because he's Irish, his role as Red the 'The man who knows how to get things' was incredible. A convicted murderer, and the only guilty man in shawshank really was what made the movie, amongst other things, so good. He would have to be the best narrator EVER!! he makes you feel as though when he speaks, you're him watching the events unfold as they happen from his perspective.The other co-stars all put in great performances, notabley Bob Gunton as the Warden, William Sadler as Heywood a fellow inmate and James Whitmore as Brooks. Clancy Brown did a great job of making you hate his character Captain Hadley, at some parts you just wanted reach through the screen and kill him yourself. And Mark Rolsten as Boggs the gay prisoner, made you shudder.But the highlight of the acting was on the on screen chemistry between Tim Robbins and Morgn Freeman the best male lead duo that I have ever seen, the way they inspire each other and the conversations they share add another dimension to the movie.The plot is good, with the ending coming as a complete surprise to me, probably because i was expecting something a little different to what I had expected, which is what makes this movie brilliant. Frank Darabout has done a great job as Director as he has shown us again later in the Green Mile. I cant believe this film did not perform in the Cinemas or did not win any awards. Words cannot possibley describe in detail just how good this movie is, go and see it for yourself, but be prepared for some real, prison violence. And remember, a good thing never dies. \n",

      "There is a scene early in the movie when the viewer is introduced for the first time to Shawshank prison. The camera takes us on an extraordinary panorama, beginning at ground level and rising up until we see the inmates crowding around like ants. It must have been shot with a sky-crane or something because there is no break in continuity. The view just goes on, up and around in a breathtaking cycle. The effect is reminiscent of the 360 degree battlefield panorama of Rod Stieger's Napoleon in 'Waterloo'. It is almost arrogant, except that it's wonderful. From this point on, I knew I was about to watch something very, very special.The film depicts the institutional brutality that sadly continues to be the hallmark or imprisonment, and how one comes to terms with it, or not. We quickly discover what happens to those who don't. Some hysterical white-collar inmate cracks-up and is beaten to death on his first night. It is a monstrous example of the ironically named 'correctional facility' at work.Morgan Freeman is another actor as remarkable for his voice as his other abilities. He is perfectly chosen as narrator.For almost 2 hours we endure the gloomy, threatening claustrophobia that makes up much of prison time, and what inmates do to gain some little respect and make life endurable. In this regard it has a lot in common with 'Midnight Express'. Except that here we are dealing with an innocent man.Music scores are perfectly chosen. The sound effects equally well matched. The viewer is taken upon a journey so complete and plausible - assisted by strong acting and excellent script - that when the extremely unlikely escape is discovered, we are left believing that too.The idea that a thunderstorm should fortuitously arrive at the very hour of need to mask the sounds of hammering, and that it would be possible to find sufficient air in the enclosed sewer-pipe, both stretch our credence a little.My favourite moment features the abscondment-on-parole of Red, who goes in search of a certain Field with a certain tree. After so long steeped in the dank, evil reek of prison one can almost smell the scents of summer, the mown hay. All is silent except for the whir of insects and distant birdsong as soft sunlight filters down through trees. The contrast is perfect, the ambiance tangible. These are surely the things to savour most when freed from permanent brutality.This, and the movie 'Fried Greeen Tomatoes' seem to perfectly counterpoint each other. They are both of equal quality and address parallels of endurance and relationships from male or female perspectives. I love 'em both as much.I'm told that each bombed at the box-office. Not enough pyrotechnics and CGI effects I guess.If you haven't seen either of them; get busy. But watch them on a decent telly with a quality independent sound-system. \n",

      "It's hard to imagine that maybe the most uplifting film of all time is set inside the walls of a prison but that is the case in The Shawshank Redemption. The film is about friendship, loyalty, and patience which may not seem like the most intriguing elements until you have seen them brought together in this film. Opening with the incarceration of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) for two life terms for the brutal killing of his wife and her lover the film seems to be heading into dark territory. Instead what we get is an examination of the triumph of human spirit. Shawshank Prison is the meanest prison around, or so says Ellis\"Red\"Redding(Morgan Freeman) in an early narration. This is where Red and Andy first meet and where the development of one of the most rewarding screen friendships begins. Tim Robbins who plays Andy gives his best performance. He carries himself in a manner unimaginable considering his predicament. His patience and strength are a marvel. Morgan Freeman turns in the performance of his career as Red who narrates the film as well as provide the realism that Andy has suppressed back. Andy is a patient man who walks the yard of Shawshank like he doesn't have a care in the world. The film's success lies in the relationship between Andy and Red. Their friendship carries them through the struggles of the prison term and us through the film. One of the most memorable endings in film history comes from their life long bond. I am being vague on details because I do not want to spoil the film for anyone who has not seen it. As far as I am concerned it is something that you should do immediately. The Shawshank Redemption does so much well. But above all it is a story of hope. The ability to persevere through any situation is the hallmark of this remarkable film. \n",

      "I'm just wondering or if we get told in some way if the letter that Andy had sent to the newspaper from the bank had any information about his innocents in the murders of his wife and her lover. This is because Capatin Hadley was arrested outside the prison and the only way that I could see this happen is if Andy had sent some information in that letter to the paper.I'm also just wondering if Norton had any sort of information about Andy's innocents. I haven't read the book \"Rita Heyworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" which is roughly based on the movie. It would be nice if I could get a reply from someone who has an answer too one of these questions. \n",

But the movie wouldn't have been excellent without the awesome casting of Tim Robbins(Andy), Morgan Freeman (Red), Bob Gunton (Warden Norton), James Handy (Brooks) and Clancy Brown (Captain Byron Hadley). The movie conveys lots of mixed messages but the most important to me is that even though we can be in dark and scary places there can always be light. Only fault that as the years went by, Morgan Freeman didn't look his age. Other then that it was a good movie with a good message that you keep watching over and over again. \n",

I found out about it 2 years after it came out and since then it's made an impression on me that affects me even to this day. The movie is brilliance and it's done so well that it upsets me to know that it didn't do as well as it should have in the box office. But it's a similar thing that paralleled The Wizard of Oz and Gone with The Wind in 1939 it did it again in 1994 with The Shawshank Redemption and Forrest Gump. This movie though as whole is one of the best films put together that shows morale code, fear and hope. It shows what can be taken from us, from freedom or someone (Tommy getting killed) from any situation that was put together but hope stays with us and cant be beaten or stolen from us unless we let it and this movie shows us that in an honest way that isn't exaggerated. To me I'll never get tired of seeing this movie nor get tired of what it means. Hope. \n",

Also the director of Shawshank died without getting what he should have receive for being such a bastard, which was quite unfair.But well, the worst punishment you could get, is not physical, nor material, it's when you discover you ruined your life, and lost your time.I gave this movie a 9, because nobody and nothing is perfect.I can guarantee that you won't regret watching this, even if it takes away 2 hours of your free time, this movie could make you realize how to spend the remaining ones of your life in the most clever way.GO FREEDOM ! :-) \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt my favourite film of all time. Ranked 2 in the top 250 films it is clear others agree with me. And when you watch this you will too. The plot may sound familiar (guy goes to jail, guy escapes jail) but this is nothing like i have seen before. It's about Andy Dufresnes (Tim Robbins) determination and persistence which keeps him going through his 19 years. But the film is also about Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman) commonly known as \"Red\". He does not claim innocence and is the only guilty man in Shawkshank. When Dufresne arrives Red makes a bet he'd be first to crack. But Andy stays strong which surprises Red. He uses this strength to keep going day after day and he passes this feeling onto Red when he tells him of a box planted under the tree. This gives Red some hope, It gives him something to look forward to and that will keep him going day by day. Without Andy Red would have nothing in life. And when you have nothing in life like Brooks did... There is nothing to keep you going onto the next day. This film is brilliantly scripted. The acting is top class and you get the feel of the innocent man amongst the guilty. The corrupt guards and wardens add to Andys story of wrong convictions and unfairly treated. He just happens to be the only innocent man in Shawshank. \n",

      "*Possible SpoilerI was fifteen years old at the time this film was released, and it instantly became one of my favorite films after the first time I watched it. Part of the film was shot 10 minutes from where I grew up at the Wyandot County Court House in Upper Sandusky, Ohio. A classmate of mine's father was a juror in the opening scenes of the film. The rest of the film was shot about 45 minutes from my home in Mansfield, Ohio at the historic Mansfield Reformatory. Every year, the famous prison has haunted tours and sleepovers during the Halloween season, and is open for historic tours during other parts of the year. There are many websites devoted to this site. Being a fairly rural area of the state, it is quite an honor to have lived near the filming of one of the best films of all time. As I have grown into an adult, I have grown to appreciate the artistic value of the film even more. Morgan Freeman delivers his best performance (all of his are great though). \"Red\" is the epitome of a man who just wants to be part of life. Although confined inside walls, he can function normally by doing things to make others happy, in turn making himself happy. He is much like any working man that lives on the outside. Andy (Tim Robbins) just amazes you with his selflessness. He sacrificed his own well-being for others many times during his stay at the Shawshank. It took him a longtime, but his desire to live eventually freed him. The film left me surprised many times. But once you have got to know Andy, nothing he does will surprise you. He's the guy you knew back in the day that had all the luck. (We've all known guys or girls like that). This film is 10 out of 10. It has moments of suspense, mystery, action, surprise, drama, sadness, and even a little comedy if you know where to look for it. \n",

I challenge you to find a movie with a better ending. Questions: Is Andy raped by the \"sisters\" or no? I thought Morgan Freeman's voice-over was kind of unclear on this point. Number two.

      "Complete void of spoilers herein, only read on if you like ridiculous praise of a movie on a mammoth scale.I just watched The Shawshank Redemption for the second time, and for the second time it took my breath away. There is just no real word to describe the extraordinary piece of cinema that has been created here.It tells the story of wrongly accused murderer, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), and his story of survival inside a maximum security prison, aided by his friendship with 'the only guilty man inside Shawshank', Ellis 'Red' Reddings (Morgan Freeman). Along the way it branches into at least six different side stories that, halfway through the movie, while still entertained, one wonders what they have to do with the plot. The answer is everything, as becomes apparent by the end.I won't bore you with details of the individual craftsmanship that went into this movie, but I will advise anyone who has not seen it to see it, and as soon as possible. Keep watching until the end, and there is no possible way you can be disappointed. It is absolutely masterly directed by Frank Darabont, and while I thought that his other Stephen King-based film, The Green Mile, was fairly slow and self-indulgent, this isn't. It is drawn out and long, but absolutely impeccable and amazingly inspirational. It delivers the message that even in the face of abject adversity, hope will always prevail. This message was recently hammed up quite terribly in \"The Two Towers\", but in The Shawshank Redemption, just one very simple quote sums it up: \"Hope is a good thing. Possibly the best thing. And no good thing ever dies\"This is one for the ages. I cannot imagine that the uplifting effect of this movie will ever die. There is no possible way it could be better. The only possible reason I can think of for not liking or being inspired by this movie is that you just don't want to. There are no two ways about it. Even after nine years, this holds strong as an absolute masterpiece of film-making, and a staggering achievement. Five stars out of five. \n",

      "**POSSIBLE SPOILERS (nothing too specific)**Watching The Shawshank Redemption is a downright religious experience; it is truly a film to treasure, and one that nobody who sees it will ever forget. Director Frank Darabont's translation of a Stephen King novella to the screen is not a great film because of the story itself-the plot is actually quite simple and could be carried out in under an hour with relative ease-but because of the way the story unfolds.  Shawshank is a lengthy film (clocking in around 150 minutes), but it doesn't feel so long because the leading actors are spot-on perfect, the pace is beautifully metered, and the emotions (which are never the least bit contrived) build to one of the tensest climaxes in American cinema.The story is told not from the perspective of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), banker imprisoned for a double-homicide he didn't commit, and the main character in this epic tale, but from the perspective of Red (Morgan Freeman), `the only guilty man in Shawshank Prison.'  Red has been in Shawshank for twenty years; he's a well-liked inmate among his peers because he's the guy that can obtain some of the luxuries of the outside world. If you want a box of cigars or a poster of your favorite pin-up girl, Red's your man.  Often, throughout the course of the film, we wonder why Andy isn't telling the story-after all, he's the character we sympathize with most.  In the end, we know why, and we're glad Red told the story, since the film ends up being more about him than Andy.  Andy, instead, is just the vehicle for Red's realization that hope and perseverance can free the human mind.While Red is the resourceful handyman, Andy is the smartest man in Shawshank.  He hatches a plan to get the other inmates to accept him by having the guards provide them with alcohol, he comes to be the tax preparer for all the guards in Shawshank as well as several neighboring prisons, he revamps the prison library, and even becomes the personal accountant to the warden, a cold man who, we learn, is just as criminal as any inmate.  Yet all the while, we don't realize just how smart Andy Dufresne is.  We believe he'll get his revenge on the legal system that landed him in jail, but this movie isn't about vengeance.  It's about making the most of a bad situation, and about the lengths a person will go to free himself-physically and spiritually.The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1994 and lost all of them, mostly to Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction (both solid films in their own right).  In any other year it may have won all seven.  Freeman definitely deserved every possible accolade for his performance, while Darabont's direction and Roger Deakins' stark cinematography bring great effect to the story.  The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most successful films ever on video, and rightfully so.  It's one of the best films ever. \n",

      "CONTAINS SPOILERS Review by Joe: `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' the original short novel by legendary author Stephen King, sparked the start of a superb movie and ongoing legend. Andrew Dufresne, a fairly young man committed murder and was sentenced to life in Shawshank prison.  There are some elements of this film that differ from elements of this novel.  And yet many things are the same.In the novel, Andy was a short, partially bald man, who was quiet and shy, and in the movie he was a tall intimidating stocky figure.  I think this difference is important in one particular scene: the prisoners are tarring the roof, and Andy overhears Hadley, a man who is angry at the world, talking about his inheritance from his deceased brother.  Andy speaks up about the taxes of the inheritance and Hadley gets furious.  I think that if in the movie he was the man described in the book, it would have made this seem weak, and Hadley probably wouldn't have thought him worthy to even speak to him. I think this movie was put together well, but to be honest, I like Stephen King's short novel better.Review by Steve: The movie was very good.  Andy's life in prison was real.  Andy really got cheated out of 20 years of his life.  Andy's in jail for something he didn't do. I especially like the scene when the warden was talking to the media. When the warden was in front of the building talking it looked like the warden had a crown on.  Showing that he was a king he had all the power. I didn't like the ending of the movie.  It was good for them because it was what they both wanted. They both wanted freedom and that's what that scene showed.  But they should have had some sort of action, like gone sailing, fishing, showed them both out to sea doing something.  Being free.  Not just on the beach hugging each other.Review by Derek: I think that the directors should have filmed the movie in Charleston, Maine because I've spent a lot of time there.  I wish I would have had a chance to see the whole movie but from what I saw it was a great movie. I liked the movie cause it seemed so real.  But what I didn't like was how the guards and the warden thought that any one who got in the way or their business they could kill them or put them in solitary confinement.  Plus I didn't like how guards treated inmates like slaves. They couldn't just face reality and treat them like equals. But it happens in prisons all over the world so that's why I liked Shawshank Redemption.Review by Brad: I liked the movie compared to the book.  I think that the movie was way better. The movie seemed to be way more interesting.  It was complimentary to Stephen King's ways of writing an intricate portrayal of an actual event that took place in Maine. One of the things I liked about the movie is the way camera angles portray power.Review by Dan: A Review of Shawshank Redemption from an Inmate's View I found the movie not nearly as enjoyable as Stephen King's `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'.  The points I found I did not agree with are they have Red's character as a black man in the movie when in the short story he was a white Irish man but it kinda adds a little laughter to a serious theme.  Second they have Andy Dufresne as a tall skinny man when in `Rita Hayworth.' he's a small and a heavy man with not much of an aura. Thirdly they have one warden Mr. Norton when there is three in the short story because it seems to the viewer that 19 years did not go by, but in a way its good so the viewer can focus his hate towards one figure. That's what I didn't like but there are more pros than cons.  The film makers did an excellent job with the lighting, the angle of the camera and the music. With these three combined it gives the feelings of dread and despair as black as death.  Freedom as high as a bird and sadness as deep as an ocean. With all these in mind it makes a great movie on a scale from 1 to 10 I'd give it 8 ½.Review by Chris: This movie was madcool. Some specific parts about this movie that I thought were pretty phat was like when the music was played by the Italian lady's singing and they all looked free.  When later on in the movie the music is really fast and strong after he's finished climbing out of the pipe and really is free.  I also like how Andy never gave up against the sisters and then finally Hadley beat the p*** out of Boggs,the guards helped him because he helped them that's pretty killer.Madcool-really good, very interesting Phat-cool interesting, awesome, madcool Pretty Killer-same \n",

Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins play the most believable and likeable characters ever.  The movie is like a good hit of ecstacy.  It builds up for so long that you really come to like Andy and hate the warden.  Then before the end he escapes, the warden throws the rock through the wall, the warden kills himself, and finally they are on a beach in Mexico.  All the special effects on earth couldn't give me a rush like the end of this movie.  It just creates this moving emotional feeling inside and you feel as vindicated as you know Andy and Red must feel.Of course there are many other great moments in the middle of the movie. For example, when they get to drink the beer and when the guy passes the test.  I could go on for hours about this movie so I'll stop now. \n",

      "**** SPOILERS HEREIN**** proceed at own risk!!!!!it is simply no wonder that shawshank redemption is as insanely popular as it is. the movie is the greatest flag-bearer for hope and the determination. i have been wanting to see this movie for a long time and recently caught it on television as part of a stephen king horror special series!!!!the movie begins at quite a slow pace and after about half an hour i was wondering why this movie was so highly rated. but slowly the movie unravels and soon i was totally caught up in its brilliance. sometimes harsh, sometimes serene, sometimes wishful, sometimes dreadful. the intensity of the despondence at shawshank prison is almost tangible.tim robbins and morgan freeman are outstanding in their roles. each character is brilliantly etched and is a delight to watch. the screenplay is the highlight of the movie and there is always a feeling of something larger lurking behind the damp grey walls of shawshank.for those who have seen the movie, an interesting point would be that the name of stephen king's novella is \"rita hayworth & the shawshank redemption\". well well!!the movie though has to be watched. it is an experience every human should go through. it takes the light at the end of the tunnel to the next plane.an elevating 10!! \n",

      "CONTAINS SPOILERS \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a film about banker Andy Dufrense(Tim Robbins) who is framed and sent to a maximum security prison for the murder of his wife and her lover.He befriends Red Redding(Morgan Freeman), who is the only guilty man in Shawshank, the prison.  Through a few brutal years, Andy finally manages to get through.  He helps prisoners graduate high school, opens a prison library, and works on the taxes for the crooked warden(Bob Gunton). Little does anybody know what his secret is, an escape.Based on a short story by Stephen King from 'Different Seasons', this is the best film about the triumph of the human spirit.  Frank Daranbot delivers a top notch drama.  This film also features an excellent musical score by Thomas Newman.  Morgan Freeman delivers,in my opinion, his best role.  Though a little cruel at some points, this film will make you want to see it again.  One of the three best films of the 1990s.  Second on my all time list. \n",

      "Like \"Pearl Harbor,\" (AAAHHH!) this film had comedy despite the fact that it was a drama. For example, when Andy is ordered to turn off music that is annoying to the Warden (but not to the rest of the prison... they just listen), Andy turns it up!But, unlike \"Pearl Harbor\" (AAAHHH!), this film actually needed a bit of GOOD laughter, whereas \"PH\" (AAAHHH!) was laughable in itself, with unneccesary BAD comedy.Anyway, I read the novella first and let me tell you, the film (edited-I watched on TNT) has many differences and add-ons. For example, that bit of comedy wasn't in the book (heck, NO comedy was in the book). Also, (spoiler) when Andy has disappeared, the Warden didn't throw his hand-carved chess pieces at the poster-he tore it down. Also, the novella wasn't 100 pages, whereas this movie (on TNT, with commercials and edits) was 3 hours whole!I am STILL deciding on where to put this better-than-most-films-these-days movie on Favorites list. I am tempted to put it near the top (not at the top-there are better films), but somewhere online someone said that it was a middle-movie (an okay one). Another person declined, but after watching again, they agreed. So, I'll put it somewhere in the middle.I liked it very much, but it's not my favorite movie ever, nor the second. Rather... ah, heck, I can't decide right now!Rating: 4.5/6 \n",

      "Spoiler Alert A few films can presume of the importance that a film like The Shawshank Redemption does. Shawshank Redemption is considered by some critics as one of the best movies in the story of American film (listed as #2 by the Internet Movie Data Base,http://www.imdb.com). For many other people the film is considered as one of those films which theme is universal and that transcends throughout the ages and decades. And this is because topics like freedom, justice and injustice, greed and honesty, and perseverance are mixed in a manner that specifies what the human condition is and will be.The performances given by Tim Robbins and the always acclaimed Morgan Freeman give the film the emotional touch that is easy to get as a viewer. The story is centered in a person called Andy Dufrense who was convicted for the murder of his wife, him, being a young and intelligent banker was one of the most promising persons in his category, but all his potential was brought down with his conviction, undoubtely unfair since it is obvious a person like Dufrense wouldn´t be capable of such a thing like murdering the person he loved with all his heart. Also the story of the \"institutionalized\" Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman, a man who lost all hope of ever going out even if he had already payed more than he had ever expected for his crime, until he met Dufrense, who as anyone could see teaches Red the meaning of what to have a dream is, even if it takes you 20 years to accomplish it.Greed comes in form of Captain Byron Hadley played by lancy Brown, an unscrupulous man, who ironicly although he directed the place were the \"bad\" element of society is reformed he was no better than the ones he subdued. Hadley since he first met Dufrense sought in him his golden egg gouse and used him to fulfill a fraud becoming Dufrense now into a real criminal, which he wasn´t until he got to jail. When the opportunity to prove Dufrense´s innocence comes, Hadley makes everything as possible to avoid that even though the assesination of a young person was in the middle. At the end, Dufrense escapes from jail through a hole he had dug for 20 years covering the evidence with several posters from the hollywood divas from those times from Rita Hayworth to Jane Fonda.But, let´s talk about Andy Dufresne for a while, let´s take the scene at the roof of the building in which Andy gets beers for his coworkers in exchange for work. At the end of the scene we can see the smile of Andy, a happy man, who was happy with small little accomplishments. Andy was someone who was talented and yet, all he wanted was a yat in Puerto Vallarta near by the beach and that would be the heaven for him. In a world full of intelligent people who use their talents to get to the top, andy was one who needed little to be happy.Of course the success of this film is based on what most of the famous films do, an utopic idea of society or how the human being should have been. Andy is the prototype of how all of us should be, never loose the sense of hope, always fight for what you want, greed and money is not good, and of course, being like this you will always succeed. After all, a movie that should be seen by everyone. \n",

      "What a remarkable film this is. I remember the first time I saw it. It was on video, since I was only 11 when it came out, and I sat down, and I had heard that it was a terrific movie, but I had no idea just how truly GREAT this movie is. After the first viewing I knew it was one of my favorites. I've only seen it three times, so as not to wear it out, and each time, I am blown away.Morgan Freeman is already one of my favorite actors, (Along with Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, and Edward Norton) and his performance here is simply the best of his career. His \"Red\" is a weathered man who has lost hope. He's not a \"bad\" man, even though he did kill a man in his youth. Morgan Freeman is calm and collected, yet his on-screen presence is so powerful. We are drawn to him, almost more-so than to Andy because Andy keeps to himself, while Red narrates. This is partly the point, to turn the audience into an inmate. We only know as much as they do about him. He isn't revealed to us directly very much. And we eventually find out why.I love the way the men of this prison use almost a hierarchy and establish their own little kingdom, with the jail, obviously as their castle. I like watching Andy as he strives to be normal, doing whatever he can to get his mind off of the fact that he's in prison. One of the film's best moments comes when Andy makes a deal that allows all of the roof workers to have a beer, and to just sit around, and be carefree for a few minutes. But for others the prison is normal, all they know, their only life. They call it \"institutionalized\" but what it really means is hopeless. And it's a constant battle to keep that from happening. And eventually it seems, that everyone caves in to the fact that they will die at that place.This is unquestionably one of the most powerful and moving films of all time. (WARNING: SPOILERS!!!) There are four ending sequences that come one after another that move so fluidly and with such grace that I am in awe just thinking about it. 1. Andy's escape and all of the explanation that goes along with it. The long tunnel of crap, Andy's joy in the pond while the rain pours upon him. 2. The day after and everything that happens to the warden and the guard are done brilliantly. 3. Red's parole hearing. At this point he just doesn't give a crap about anything anymore. He talks about his regret, not because he thinks it will get him out, but so that they will know that his punishment is not so much prison as it is wishing he could've made a better decision. Wishing that the young Red would've had guidance. 4. The reunion at the end while Red narrates. The most wonderful lines come when he's on the bus, and we hear his voice over about how he has shrugged off his \"Institutionalization\" and is ready to not know what happens next. This is the absolute perfect tone to end the movie on. What sheer brilliance. It is sad that this film didn't win ANY Oscars. It certainly deserved to. \n",

      "Interpretation, spoilers: Brooks represents complete complacency with life, so much so that any disturbance causes anxiety and suicidal ideation. Red also, for a time, represents this complacency. This movie is not simply a prison story, its message is generalized to mankind in general and it can be assumed that this complacency also represents modern man's need for routine - to the detriment of authentic living. It takes an unjustly imprisoned man, Andy, to demonstrate to Red the life-or-death importance of hope and the freedom allowed by hope. As shown, hope entails slight fear because it necessarily interferes with order in life. Andy illustrates that this fear is a part of living, and renunciation from it results in an ingenuine sort of living. Red soon realizes - given the rock hammer, the poster, and the mexico plans - that Andy had never given up his hope despite 19 years in prison. Hope and a sense of freedom and allowed even in prison, but not to all (music scene). For Red, it takes an actual physical freedom to live with a sense of hope. Andy, by exuding auras of hope from the beginning - though he would be expected to despair the most given his innocence - helps Red reach an epiphany of sorts; certainty and hope are mutually exclusive, and hope is always to be preferred. The Brook's path is shirked, and Red chooses life in all of its confusion, because true hope is omnipotent. \n",

      "Tremendously involving drama. In my opinion, the best new movie in the last 10 years or so. My only quibble is that the film deals with prison life in a somewhat unrealistic, non-threatening or idealistic way compared to some prison movies but otherwise it is terrific. The main characters are quite human and engaging. I found myself almost projecting, mentally, into the group as they share their day-to-day experiences in the joint. Also, the film has a happy ending where the good guy succeeds and the bad guy gets his. \n",

      "<<WARNING: EXTREME SPOILERS>>I won't argue that this is a really good film. It is. But I've always felt it's been built up a bit too much. It's well-structured, well-paced, and Morgan Freeman gives a brilliant performance, along with all of his co-stars. But it's still something of a modern fairy tale. We never doubt that things will turn out all right in the end for Andy and Red, or that Norton will get his comeuppance. This, combined with a tendency to get cloying, particularly with the opera record and the spunky kid, effectively knocks it out of the running as one of the all-time greats.All this aside, however, it's impact can't be denied either. Frank Darabont may have let his sentimentality go raging out of control on The Green Mile next, but he just enough restraint here to move us almost to tears. And this same emotional black-and-white treatment allows plot points that might have been laughed of in a more cynical film to feel perfectly satisfying. Tell me you didn't raise a fist in triumph when Norton blew his brains out. And regarding sentiment, it certainly wasn't 1994's worst offender. Matching Forrest Gump for saccharine value would tax even Darabont's skills. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is one of the wisest and most touching films I have ever seen.  It tells the tale of the friendship between two convicted murderers: Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman). Many things make this a good film: its genuine depiction of prison life, the wonderful performances from Robbins and Freeman, the great music from Thomas Newman.  For all of these qualities, The Shawshank Redemption is worth seeing.What makes the film great for me, though, is the way that in its depiction of prison life, the film becomes an existential display of how most of us live our own lives.  ***SPOILER AHEAD***  Throughout the film, we are confronted by how people choose to accept their freedom.  Brooks, the old librarian, who has been in prison for almost his entire life, becomes scared of the freedom he enjoys, and can not take it.  The same fate almost befalls Red, but his redemption comes as he is able to accept the unpredictability of his life, and draw inspiration from Andy.  The film rings absolutely true, I know many people who are too afraid to chase after their own dreams, and would rather stay in a mundane yet predictable and secure job.  \"Prison life consists of routine, and then more routine,\" Red says in the course of the film.  So, I imagine, do many people's lives.  The Shawshank Redemption is about breaking away from the routine, taking risks, and going after your dreams without compromise. \n",

And you go to prison for what 30? 40 years? and day after day you dig and you dig and you dig, and with what?? a spoon!! I know I would have gone nuts by then.

I still smile with utter joy in the end and get choked up during the scene with Brooks. Frank Darabont is one of the greatest directors I have ever seen, and it is a shame that he has only made a few movies. The music in this movie is also perfect. If you haven't seen this movie, which I am surprised to hear that many people have not, you should rent it immediately. Nevermind, don't just rent it.... buy it. You will not regret it.

I think if he started acting in Hollywood when he was 20 instead of 50, he would have quite a few Oscars under his belt.Why does this film get better and better? Probably because you can find new things in each viewing. Knowing what will happen allows you to look around and check out the surroundings. You can see little things that contribute to understanding the story better.SPOILER ALERT!The best part? The very end when Andy Dufresne escapes and shows that with determination, that a person can do anything they want including getting away from a prison after digging a hole in the wall for 19 years.SPOILER END!Overall, this movie is one of the best of all time.

The movie may well be enjoyable, but in the end it is no more than that, enjoyable, and that is pushing it. The director's involvement with other movies outside of this speak volumes: Green Mile is in a similar mould,whilst The Mist shows his continued obsession with Stephen King. With writing credits on over five different mutations of Young Indiana Jones's, his incompetence is evident. At the end of the day, a Hollywood remake by M.

Shawshank Redemption was visually boring and seemed to drag on for hours and hours without reaching any type of plot until three quarters into the film, and the plot itself was pretty unrealistic, sorry but what are the chances of him meeting a man, who knows the man who really killed his wife? ...unlikely. I must admit, its not a bad film and i'd watch it again just for the ending, which I didn't see coming at all.

You have a few characters supplied solely to provide the \"sad\" moments, and everything else is just built up to provide a fulfilling and completely happy ending. Now I'm no prison warden, but I would look behind my tenant's posters (more in case they've tunneled into each other's rooms for a little lights-out action).Anyway, as I thought about it more, the movie started to remind me of another classic prison flick, Cool Hand Luke. Unfortunately for Shawshank, Tim Robbins is no Paul Newman, and whatever stiff played the warden is no Struther Martin. Perhaps more importantly, though, is the way in which Cool Hand Luke presents a much more believable series of events, with no fairy tale ending. Luke's omission of the whole prison-love thing is even forgivable thanks to the inclusion of a classic car wash scene. One does not need a prisoner who happened to be roommates with a prisoner who happened to kill the wife of a man who happens to be a prisoner to create drama. It's a truth Shawshank dearly needs to learn. \n",

Due to all the hype, I was expecting to feel the same after watching \"Shawshank\" but all I feel is that most of the film is instantly forgettable and cheesy. I suspect that most of the people who have rated this film a 9 or 10 haven't had the opportunity to see many films that haven't had the \"Hollywood\" conveyor belt behind them.

      "Once again, another year (or Christmas) goes by and this movie is thrust onto the television screen for all to enjoy. And what an enjoyable movie it is - as I've seen it countless times now.The major theme that runs throughout this film is hope. The main character Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, is the one who shines a beacon of hope like an Olympic athlete carrying the torch to the cauldron, and this starts from time he enters Shawshank prison. The other main character, Red, played by Morgan Freeman, said he took to liking him from the beginning as \"he strolled, like a man in a park without a care or a worry in the world, like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. Yeah, I think it would be fair to say...I liked Andy from the start.\" And Andy even inspires Red to \"hope\" for a life outside of the prison walls and to join him in a free life on a Mexican beach by the Pacific sea.And the theme of hope is also enforced by a darker side. The prison librarian, Brooks, played by James Whitmore, who has been a resident for 50 years, is given parole and leaves prison to \"enter\" life outside of the four walls. And upon realising that he can't come to terms with the pace of life and no family or friends to turn to, he loses hope, and ends his life. I think that this theme is the magic that most people like about this movie. It's the glue that joins the friendship between Andy and Red. And its the thing that viewers, like me, can relate our life and experiences to.Even after so many viewings I still feel that this movie is powerful and a revelation to pretty much every person. Its pretty much a powerful contemporary tale of a Biblical story. A story about hope, friendship, loss, betrayal, contempt (particularly what the antagonist prison warden Norton brings), brutality, injustice, crime and so forth.I think that this movie deserves to be played on a yearly basis, particularly on Christmas day. It's a modern day retelling of a Biblical story. I believe everyone should see this movie at least once. \n",

SHAWSHANK often shows up as the \"best film of all time\" on various movie lists - including here on the IMDb - and, whilst I don't necessarily agree about that, it is a very good film indeed, near flawless in fact.Every technical element of the film is spot-on, from direction to music, editing, and acting; Morgan Freeman delivers his best ever performance whilst Tim Robbins shows us what a great character actor he is. Even better, for a genre fan like me, is seeing acting favourites like Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Brian Libby, and James Whitmore all appearing in the film together and playing more than just stock good or bad guy roles. Every actor is great here, and the script (which sticks closely to King's writing) is nigh-on perfect.

      "Stephen King is of course, a gifted storyteller. Maybe this might not be his most personal writing, if you want to read a very insightful book on prison detention and the atrocities and misconducts that exist, read the Star Rover, it is fantastic.To me, this is filled with far too many shortcuts, basically everything is in hand for Dusfrene to escape. The perfect location, the cell on the extremity of the facility floor, yet we can't really see where the foundation leads to, apparently it leads into the pipelines. Also the great timing, the fact that he manages to work out taxes, bills, finances for a 100 person, and in charge of the library, and with a rock hammer that he trades from Red, he breaches a cement wall. I don't get how any of this is realistic - since it's a King's series, might as well turn into a fantasy. But it's incoherent, lacks coherent flow, it intends to empathy with cons who really seem to be very friendly people (sort of), and might be innocent. I'm not sure these people are all quite recommendable and the camaraderie between detainees necessary - it is certainly not the same nature between workers that are part of a union. I fail to understand how a movie can go two hours and then in a span of ten minutes, retrace ten years of escape planning without giving us any hints on where Dusfrene will strike. The scenes where he is revealed that a mobster murdered his wife and her lover makes no sense, it doesn't work, I don't understand it - the scene when he plays opera is tacky - again, this movie reaches. And then of course, a post-modern ending to a movie that is set in the 60s, where two guys meet on the beach, Dusfrene treating a beat up boat. Again, the development reaches, it is just a series of shortcuts that arrange the directors in order to get through it by just being lazy. The performances are dull, there is hardly any real focus, any real acting, it doesn't focus enough on the characters, it moves too fast.This movie just doesn't work. \n",

      "SR is a good film. In my view it is not a great film! Firstly - it is lazy film-making to have a character (Red, in this case, played by Morgan Freeman) as a narrator to tell us what is happening. The film itself should convey the narrative. If someone has to read the narrative I might as well just buy the book!Secondly - the story is simply not believable! I can't believe that a prisoner gets to do all the tax returns for the guards and governor. I can't believe that a prisoner entering the prison just happens to have a heard another prisoner in another prison boast about committing the murder for which our hero is serving time. Thirdly - the story all ends up 'happy ever after' which is seldom the case but which, I suppose, satisfies those of a simplistic/idealistic nature. I prefer more grit and realism.Fourthly - the 'goodies' (Dufresne, Red, Brooks) and the 'baddies' (Bogs, Hadley, Norton) are drawn so simplistically they might as well have been wearing white and black hats! There is no depth of character here.Fifthly - and most damning - this film made me feel very little! I didn't really care about the characters (except - maybe - Red). The plot with Dufresne taking on his alter-ego on escape was clever and the suicide of Brooks was a bit moving but this was not enough for me. I go to the cinema to be moved by the plot or the characters; to be made to think; or simply to laugh! This was not a laughing film but neither did it reach me on any other level.It was also too long! \n",

      "Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul. \n",

If we go back a bit we get to the saddest bit in the movie. When, spoilers, Brooks dies. He had a bird called Jake at the prison that he let free. When he got his parole, he went to work for a grocery store. The problem was, he had been in prison for too long. He didn't remember how to live in a world outside the prison. One day, he couldn't take it anymore. he carved into the wall \"Brooks was here\" and hung himself at the spot.After Andy escaped from the prison, he let Red know where he was headed. When Red got his parole, he went to follow where Andy was. It was a long journey, but he made it. It ended at a scene where Andy was working on a boat and Red walking up to him.To sum up, this deserves to be the most liked movie all time.

      "In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi \n",

Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. \"When they put you in that cell,\" Red says, \"when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.\" Watching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I saw it.

      "This movie is a masterpiece. You may have seen some good movies but few can compare to this one. This is the plot. In 1947 a wrongly accused banker named Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank Prison for murdering his wife. He meets the corrupt Warden, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) and the brutal corrections officer, Captain Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown). He also meets the prison fixer Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman) who was also incarcerated for murder. Andy and Red soon become good friends. Then one day while tarring the license plate factory roof, Andy helps Captain Hadley organize his money in a way that the government will be unable to take any taxes. Hadley tells the other officers about it, including Warden Norton and Andy is soon doing tax returns for all the guards in Shawshank. Life is becoming better for Andy and his fellow inmates, when he pushes for more books for the prison library. Meanwhile the old prison librarian Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore) is paroled from Shawshank. But Brooks can not adapt to life on the outside and hangs himself. Then things get worse when Norton tries to get more money from illegal activities using Andy. In 1963 a new prisoner named Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) arrives at Shawshank and reveals that he knows the man that killed Andy's wife. Andy tries to bring this up to Norton, but Norton puts Andy in solitary and has Hadley kill Tommy to keep him quiet. Now Andy has just about had enough. In 1947 Red got Andy a rock hammer, which he used to dig a tunnel under his Rita Hayworth poster. When he was released from solitary years later he uses it and escapes Shawshank. He turns Norton and Hadley to the police, who arrest Hadley. Norton on the other hand kills himself. In 1967 Red is paroled. He fears he will end up like Brooks but he made a promise to Andy to help him set up a hotel in Mexico so Red travels there where the two friends are united. This film is great for a number of reasons. The friendship aspect between Andy and Red which grows over a long period of time. It also addresses the issue of rehabilitation and if prisoners who have been in there a large portion of their lives can ever be rehabilitated or if they just become adapted to prison life so much that they falter if sent to the outside world.

      "As of March 2012, Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption is sitting pretty on the \"IMDB Top 250\" list with 731,886 ratings averaging at about 9.2/10. That's astounding. On Rotten Tomatoes, a site much more critical where it is a rarity that new movies possess a \"fresh\" rating, the film has merited a 90%. Another commendable achievement. I bring these two facts up because I'm just amazed at how high the film is ranked. Here's a film that holds the \"IMDB Top 250\" list by a long shot, yet doesn't immediately come to people's mind when thinking \"the best movie of all time.\" Of course, being on the \"IMDB Top 250\" doesn't qualify as an official listing. Being featured on AFI's list is more respectable, but still, it is subjective. Just a bit more broader and stronger, since a group of high intellectuals choose the films. If one looks further down the \"Top 250\" list, you'll see a number of questionable entries such as The Dark Knight, Inception, and Toy Story 3. Their presence doesn't necessarily mean they're the best - just the highest rated by people.But I have no quibbles about Shawshank's placing on the list; it is a wonderful, wholesome parable about redemption and reassurance of one's self worth while locked inside a penitentiary. We are met with characters who are trying to escape the confines of a monotonous lifestyle in prison, bot mentally and physically, and find a rare amount of comfort when with each other. The film is adapted from Stephen King's short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption - a novella that isn't so much physical suspense and horror as it is psychological horror; a different route for King, an author who has focused so much on the supernatural and the victimized outcasts in his long career.We are placed in Shawshank State Penitentiary, located in Maine in 1947, where Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is convicted of murdering his cheating wife and her lover and is given two life sentences. Andy assures he is innocent, but circumstances prove differently. He meets Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Freeman), a man too serving life, who acts as a con man who can get you anything you want as long as you give him his asking price plus 20%. At first, Red doesn't think too much of Andy, betting ten cigarettes with his buddies that he'll cry the first night in prison.Andy doesn't cry. He seems rather content, despite the treatment and hell he has been through. As time passes, by time I mean years and eventually decades, Andy's relationship with Red grows. They become understanding of each others positions, and Red takes a rare liking to the man. So do many other prisoners. At first, Andy is a victim of mistreatment and abuse from his villainous and heartless prisoners, but he eventually keeps his head held high, and works out deals with Warden Samuel Norton, who is played by Bob Gutton in a scarcely recognized performance that is equal parts frightening and breathtaking, to do odd-jobs around the prison to earn money, but more importantly, respect.Not only do the prisoners become smitten with him, but the guards, policemen, and suits alike. They admire his persistency. There comes a time where Andy desperately wants more funding for Shawshank, not just for bars, guards, and walls, but for books and to assimilate growth for the feeble and decrepit library currently in the prison. The guard tells him that he can write as many letters as he wants but the state government won't pay any mind. So, Andy patiently writes one letter every week to try and convince them why extra funding is vital.Here's where the spoiler comes in. The film's main morals are optimism, self worth, and hope. The film's tagline perfectly spells out its identity; \"Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.\" There is a character in the film named Brooks (Whitmore), who is the prison trustee. Upon being released from the penitentiary, Brooks commits suicide by hanging himself. The reason was because he never had any sort of dreams or plans. Never any vision of hope or compassion for anyone. He was just a human being living in fear. Andy succeeds because he has learned to carry optimism on his shoulders. He eventually teaches Red the same lesson.The spoiler's over. Moving on, the film illustrates the passing time, which I mentioned was decades, beautifully and naturally. The film will seem long to some, but it shows how slowly the prison life plods along. How mundane and redundant it must get to get up, confined to small rooms, and work for very low wages every day. And you thought your corporation job was miserably insufferable.But where Shawshank really excels is in its humanism. It evokes prisoners as people, with morals and livelihood. Not as monsters. It is true, many, many people in prison deserve to be there, but we never look past the caricature of a psychopath or a deviant when we think about what kinds of people are really in there. They're not all bad people. People who question me on that should contemplate long and hard on this question; is Red a bad person? Or even a monster? The Shawshank Redemption is a marvelous journey through parts rarely explored. It is immersing in not only its characters and story, but in its touching, light cinematography which projects a wide range of dispositions throughout the entire excursion. Rarely does a film rub us this way, and rarely does one seem to rub everyone the same way. All the more reason, its placement on the \"Top 250\" really isn't an exaggeration.Starring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and Bob Gutton. Directed by: Frank Darabont. \n",

But what makes this a favorite is a gimmick. At the finish-line of the film we feel that rise of exhilaration where all is made equal. The antagonists meet their ends and the heroes escape unscathed. The entire structure of the film moves us and captivates us...Andy, the perfect victim, faces guiltless punishment with little complaint and furrowed hope. Freeman's character smiles in his wise way as counts the weeks he knows he deserves. The film's theme of hope becomes apparent early on, and is not distinct from other 90s dramas. Even so, it works with the film's tensions and transfers that hope to the viewer in an unusually effective way. Sure, its 90s sentimentality, and its not great cinema. But its like a potent glass of wine, and can take our minds off our own problems and drop us into that ever-circling illusion of hope that spurts from arts of this sort. \n",

Inside, he befriends Red (Freeman), another inmate, and keeps making changes around the place, which worries the prison warden.I watched the film when I found out that it had beat \"The Godfather\" to the top position on IMDb's Top 250 movies list. It was great, but I don't quite think it deserves the Nr 1 position. Don't get me wrong, the film is more than worth watching, but there's a lot of movies out there, just as good as this one and there's nothing outstandingly special about this one. It's great, nonetheless, and I can strongly recommend it.9/10 \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption (1994) I've seen this film in its entirety now. Initially, I was afraid it would be a violent prison movie with very little meaning and would have very little to move me to tears. But it did. The film was Oscar worthy but it was a film that lost that year to \"Forest Gump\". Its release on VHS made the film very popular. Cable television airs the film frequently and it's even the stuff that film screenplay classes study as a sample of brilliant movie. Based on the short story by Stephen King \"Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption\" it tells the story of wealthy banker Andy (Tim Robbins) accused of murdering his wife and her lover. The time at the start of the film is the 1940's and by the end of the film it's the 1960's. Andy has been sent to Shawshank, a notorious prison (in Washington state or Oregon) where harsh discipline is provided by the Warden (Bob Gunton) and by its captain of prison guards. The elements of a prison movie are indeed here (nightmarish conditions, cruel punishment, gay prisoners raping straight/hetero prisoners) but it becomes a prison movie at a higher level with its theme of redemption and humanity, hope and perseverance. The bond between Morgan Freeman's character and Tim Robbins is perhaps the most poignant relationship of any two men portrayed on film. The prisoners have lost hope and although not bitter, become very comfortable with prison life and know no other type of life. This was the tragedy of the prison librarian who after decades of prison life, could not cope with the real world that had changed after his release. His suicide is extremely depressing. The \"bad guys\" turn out to be not the criminals who attempt to rehabilitate themselves but the hypocritical and cruel Warden. Andy is innocent as proved by a later inmate's confession to knowing the true culprit (played by Gil Bellows) but the Warden is too bent on keeping his image of having always done justice and keeps Andy in prison. The grim aspects of the film are nevertheless lightened by humor, good writing, nuance in character and scenes that have such power and subtlety. The scene in which Andy plays an opera album (Le Nozze Di Figaro by Mozart, duet \"Sull'aria from the 1968 Karl Bohm album with Edith Mathis and Gundula Janowitz) is so moving and so touching. Andy's subsequent escape and the table-turned justice when the investigation into the corruption of the prison leads to the demise of the administration.This movie ranks as one of the finest made in the 1990's, with excellent writing and fine acting. It's a movie that has become a classic and that continues to hold audiences enthralled. \n",

      "Yes this is simply a magnificent piece of work which remains powerful and moving and probably always will.It's been 14 years but who can forget such a masterpiece.This is a movie about how strong the human faith and spirit can be.Even in the most difficult moments we have to remain strong and believe in justice.This is what Shawshank is all about.I have never read the Steven King novel but he definitely should be proud that a director such as Frank Darabont has the passion and desire in making a powerful and faithful adaptation to King's work.A moving film with superb performances from all the actors but the real credit goes to Tim Robbins as the wrongfully accused Andy Dufresne whose spirit and will help him find freedom and Morgan Freeman as Ellis 'Red' Redding who serves a life-long sentence but hopes he can be freed from guilt.Throughout the movie we witness much suffering,injustice and sorrow but that's what makes the characters so pleasant and worth sympathizing for.Andy's desire to become a free man again is truly a magical but also difficult adventure.But he never loses his hope and that is what helps him succeed.The final scene when Andy and Ellis meet each other outside the steel cage prison is phenomenal and touching.It is a real shame that a movie so great didn't win a single Oscar although it had 7 nominations.А real unfairness cause this movie is indeed better than Forrest Gump.In conclusion I'll just say that Shawshank is a timeless masterpiece and deserves to be in the top 10 greatest films of all time. \n",

      "The shawshank redemption is the greatest film of all time, in my opinion. Having read great reviews for the film, i was determined to watch it myself. And that was probably the greatest film decision ever made by me. I will never forget the engrossing intensity of this masterpiece, it will stay with me and many others for years to come.It centres around a wrongly convicted prisoner Andy Dufresne and another nicknamed Red by his friends. After Red sees the wrongful imprisonment he becomes Andy's best friend and they create an unbreakable bond that is the core of the film. Years go by in Shawshank prison and the pair live with the tortures of shawshank. The neglect, the murder and the horror.But Andy changes this. He does extraordinary things for the inmates. HE befriends the guards, builds a big library and helps people with their problems. He saves them from institutionalisation.In the end an incredible series of events allows Andy to turn these factors on the prison and to get the responsible people imprisoned themselves. Andy escapes and leaves for a new life abroad. Red is released soon after and follows him. The ending sees them reunited.This is a definitive tale of how the human spirit can be denied nothing. \n",

But i looked at its rating being no.2 and thought \"really\". I was then desperate to see what makes this film the top of the nineties. Watched it with my family and it simply blew me away. The way it was sad was happy just realising that Andy difference (who was arrested for murdering his wife and her lover when drunk) was all this time innocent after spending 19 years in shawshank prison. its the police that show who are the good guys but in this its the other way round and the way it was done was exciting and intelegant.The scripts was fantastic, the acting was sensational and most of all the story was one the best ever explained in a film (infact the best ever).we all have our opinions but if you think this film is rubbish for no specific reason then there is something wrong with you. \n",

      "This is probably one of the best films of all time.IMDb ranks this as the second best film of all time behind \"The Godfather\".It can arguably be the best film of all time considering that its message of hope and inspiration to everyone.It is a short story from Stephen King.The Shawshank Redemption is a poignant story of Andy Dufresne,a wrongly convicted killer who was sent for two life sentences to Shawshank Prison in Maine.It tells us on how Andy lived inside the walls of the Shawshank,being raped from time to time by convicted homosexuals felons,his friendship with Red,having a sense of hope despite of his seemly hopeless situation,making the most of his life by using his accounting skills by helping the guards in their income tax and cleaning the warden's dirty money and to finally escaping from prison through a hole in the wall hidden under poster of women such as Rita Hayworth and Rachel Welsh.Great acting especially by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.Direction was superb by first time director Frank Darabont.The musical score was also good.I view this film from time to time to remind myself that there is hope in all situations even those I consider hopeless ones.It also a story of letting go of hatred and letting love flow into your heart despite of being around despicable characters.Aside from that,this film is neither contrived nor manipulative as it is full of surprises.It will truly be enjoyed by anybody who love great films and those who wants films that can truly uplift the human spirit.In the end,this movie will be talked about for the next 20 to 50 or more years to come.Personally it my favorite film of more than a thousand films I seen in my life for it is a classic film on hope and redemption. \n",

      "I saw this movie mainly because it was rated so highly in IMDb. It was a decent movie but it should not be number 2. It has Morgan Freeman and his wonderful voice so that's certainly a plus. The messages of the bad guys getting it in the end is nice as well as keeping one's hope alive in adverse circumstances. I didn't really think the gestapo like guard, who is able to kill anyone on a whim, was very believable. Even convicted felons have loved ones who would want answers. Besides, guards know that one day the tables may be turned on them and this usually tempers their cruelty. Vicious guards are usually \"dealt with\" by the inmates, so I don't believe a guard like this could last long, and certainly not over 20 years. And how is it that the warden and chief guard are in the same job at the same prison for over 20 years? I don't really buy the massive kickbacks the warden was getting continuously either. Prison labor in the USA usually involve trash picking, farming & soap making for institutional use and license plate stamping. These are not highly profitable industries. Neither was I too thrilled by the subtle cynicism aimed at the Bible and those who read it. Lots of convicts \"get religion\" and it is generally a good thing. Also, the quick series of mini-scenes leading me by the hand through the resolution (baptism by sewage, screaming headlines, screaming sirens, arrests and suicide) seemed fairytale like. At least you can say that the movie raises awareness of the fact that there are wrongly convicted people in prison and that savage inmates beat and rape each other. I did like the demeanor of the main character, Andy, our victim cum hero. A mix of being quiet, brooding, deliberate, cautious, willful, sly and subdued. This is a nobler hero than what you see in many Hollywood movies. And Morgan's performance as Red reminds us that, felon or not, inmates are still quite capable of humanity. So in general, I didn't mind watching this movie. It entertained me. I just wouldn't include it in my list of best movies. I would not want to watch it again. \n",

      "After just seeing this,i have to say i think its one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story.And one of the few films that can be called a \"moden classic\". The Plot:After the police in Maine find the bodies of a married woman and her lover,who were shot eight times.They bring in the married woman's husband.A hot-shot banker Andy Dufren(Tim\"The Mystic River\" Robbins) .Who clams that he is not guilty.At the end of the case,Andy is found guilty and given two life sentences at Shawshank prison Maine.When he is first there he is very closed off from everyone.And has fights with a prison group called \"The Sisters\".Until he tells a guard how to keep money from a will.While in there,he gets the trust of the guards and the warden and builds a strong friendship with a black marketeer named Red(played fantastically by Morgan\"The Dreamcatcher,The Se7ven\"Freeman).Things are going well,till an inmate Tommy,tells Andy,that in a prison he was in,he met the man who did the murder Andys in Shawshank for.The warden,who thinks Tommy is to much of a risk for his money business due to Andy doing all work for him),so he kills Tommy.After this,Andy decides its time he gets out of Shawshank.View on the film:The cast. This is one of the rare films,where all the cast just click into there roles.The two leads Robbins and Freeman,who give some of there best work in this film.The way they work and build there friendship in the film,that is sadly rarely seen in any movies.The supporting characters in the film do a really good job at standing out and not feeling like they are just card-board cut outs.The main one in the supporting cast that stand out is James Whitmore as Brooks.who makes a very enjoyable characters,who you feel very sad,to see go out in a very sad way.The Screenply/Direction.Wirter/director Frank\"The Green Mile\" Darabont (who made a student-film based on a King short story:The Woman in the Red Room),does a screenplay that easily improves on the short story.While Kings short story spent (i feel) a bit to much time on the exposition in his story,while Darabont makes sure to keep the set-up going at a good pace,and to tighten some of the story lines(Brooks was hardly in the short story,Tommy was not killed).But he makes sure to keep the feel of the story so they do not feel as strange add-ons to the story.The direction the Darabont does is to make sure to see the actors work build in the scenes,while doing a good job at keeping the film going at a pace that does not feel over-long (something that is rare with movies now). Final view on the film:A movie anyone can enjoy,from age 18-80! \n",

The story is good, but not excellent. The acting of the biggest part of the cast is good, but I really can't identify myself with Andy, the main character. He is sentenced to life imprisonment, while being innocent. Though, he just doesn't do it for me. You would expect me to feel sympathy for him, because of his situation. To a certain degree I do of course, as I do with anyone who is done injustice. But that is not enough, that's why I think this movie is overrated. \n",

      "One of the most satisfying movies ever. Anyone who has seen this film is being gradually overwhelmed by the injustice towards a single man; and while the scenario unfolds a grim, but also an unpredictable future, the hero reveals at the end his so far unrealistic stance in everything inside the prison. Redemption is not a utopia on this film. A scarce thing to see in the majority of today's movies. It perfectly reflects an every day person's point of view in assessing things and his life by \"get busy living or get busy dying\". And although it contains some dramatic characters, it gives the final sensation to the audience that hope can really change things, no matter the costs involved. A sensation that is amiss from today's movies, which try to present a realistic ending or character. Movies were not made to be totally realistic and this movie proves it magically. \n",

      "First of all i enjoyed this film immensely. It was well shot, highly emotive and contained two great lead performances, but the fact remains that this movie is perhaps too overrated in the grand scheme of cinema.It must not be forgotten that this film is an adaptation of a short story and as such the narrative requires a little more depth. One should also take into account the film's cult status as a sleeper hit (which never the less underlines its definite quality) as reason to be cynical over its actual significance in American popular cinema.However, the film is undoubtedly one of the finest examples of the prison genre, certainly ranking alongside the likes of Cool Hand Luke. The relationship of the main protagonists is perhaps one of the reasons for this as is the movies themes and contextual references. As a result this is a fine picture which inspires its audience to question justice and honour in a non too clichéd way. \n",

I'm so glad I finally got to see this film. This is easily one of the greatest films of all time. I couldn't believe the outstanding job done by all of the actors. I've seen very few scripts on the level of this one, but have never seen so many strong performances from the entire cast.Morgan Freeman is incredible as Red and narrates the action better than any other voice-over I've ever heard. I was very surprised with Tim Robbins. For some reason I still thought of him as Nuke Laloosh and never dreamed he had this kind of acting ability. The story is incredible and the dialogue keeps the entire film rolling. Two and a half hours go by like nothing. I also have to applaud William Sadler, who showed great versatility (watch Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey or Die Hard 2 to see what I mean). The film is intriguing as well as inspiring at the same time. I found myself inwardly cheering for Andy to escape from Shawshank and was even happy when he is shown emerging from the sewer tunnel. His reunion with Red is almost tearjerking. The movie managed to have a happy ending without it seeming to be another unrealistic Hollywood Ending.This film is definitely a must-see. I have seen Braveheart, and though I thought it was fantastic it doesn't come anywhere near the power of Shawshank Redemption. I doubt another cast ensemble of incredible acting talent will ever match this one. Easily a 10 on the IMDb.com scale. \n",

I'm one of the most opinionated stubborn sh...uhh so and so's.... in the world.So I guess first and foremost did I like it. No!..........Just kidding. How can you fail to?

It's one of those movies confined to the small, smokey, pokey corners of a pub when the issue of greatest film of all time comes up. There's always a 'goodfellas' and a 'Godfather trilogy' and an 'Empire Strikes back' 'Labyrinyth' (?) Voice in the crowd ,(I mix in strange circles) But its fairly unanimous, everyone likes this film. So why?Where do I start. Morgan Freeman...Goes without saying. Tim Robbins...Not sure anyone else could play Dufresne now. Bob Gunton....Born to play evil. William sadler...Under-rated.But it's not really the actors or the Director/photography etc. It's the script. Beautifully constructed. It flows like liquid perfection. Morgan Freeman's VO helps no end. (Brad Pitt described it in 'Se7en' commentry as the voice of god).I had the fortune to watch this before the hype. I got it out on video the day it came out cause I was a fan of Morgan Freeman. I sat there in silence for fifteen minutes after the final credit had scrolled past my screen. It's that good. Breathtaking. (spoiler) When Red wanders across that beach and we see Dufresne there, and the camera slowly pans upwards and away, you know you've been part of something special. I'm not a fan of sickly sweet 'hollywoodised' endings but every now and then they get it right.I should stop now cause I could go on for ever. (The 'record' scene, Brook's parole, the 'beers on the roof', the 'poster', the 'salvation comes from within' rock hammer).I better stop there. Need to take a tablet.

      "This movie was an incredible disappointment. I came into watching this movie looking for some deep introspective storytelling, and all I got was a pile of steaming feces. Now one major disappointment (spoilers ahead), was that the characters didn't make ANY fart jokes. Not even once! Now you may call this childish, but I believe that fart jokes are the pinnacle of introspective, existential comedy that really elevates the themes of a plot to another level. Instead, all the jokes fell flat and didn't really make me think about the deep universal consequences of flatulence. Another major complaint was the cast. Yes, I know this is something I cannot change, but I believe the cast would have much better if instead of Morgan Freeman, they cast incredible method actor Dylan Sprouse as Red. I believe Mr. Sprouse would have taken the character of Red to the next level instead of the flat, one dimensional character that Mr. Freeman \"acted\" as (if you would call that acting). The one high point in this movie was the large amount of diversity. I was really happy seeing an Asian, lesbian character as the main character. That kind of diversity is what Hollywood needs. My only wish is that she would be played by a more versatile actor, like Jared Leto or Ashely Tisdale. Overall, this was a disappointment of a movie, and really did not merit the awards it got. \n",

      "I did not see a \"goof\" submission area, so I feel compelled to comment on this movie's fatal flaws.Andy's cell was consistently laid out even right up to the night of his escape as he sat on his bed staring at the Rachel Welch poster. There in lies the flaw. If Andy crawled through his snug tunnel as depicted, with his clothes in tow, how did he get that poster to lay so flat to where it even appeared to be glued to the wall? It was so flat that even the Warden's commotion (rock throwing) in an open-air cell never moved that poster once. Given that, what about the sanitation pipe area that was equally open and subject to drafts and air movements, which would have easily moved the poster. Nailing, tacking, Velcro, and taping are out too. Even if he had tried to exit feet first he would have had to move some furniture, given the height of the tunnel's access off the ground. The guard found nothing unusual in the cell, as if Andy had vanished into thin air!The sanitary pipe leaves a lot to be desired as well. A thick-walled pipe of that diameter would need to be saw-cut in two places and have the section removed in order to allow enough room for Andy's body to fit. Armed with only a rock it would have taken Andy another year to get through the pipe. The director would have been better off installing a manhole access.Last but not least, the wool suit Andy wears in the bank looks spectacular for being crumpled up in a plastic bag only hours before the bank opened. Given the location of his rain soaked prison clothes and the time of day after a 500 yard crawl, Andy would have hastily changed in the rain and that suit would have been ruined. Unless he was packing a London Fog topcoat with him he would have had to make a visit to a dry cleaner and had a two-day wait on his clothes at best. I wish he would pack for me on my trips!\"Redemption\" is a good movie, but not a great one. \n",

      "If this was the Wizrd of Oz or Bambi then I could understand the appeal of the movie and would rate it accordingly but what this movie is I just do not know and no one can seem to tell me when I ask so why it is considered such a great movie other than: \"Aww it was nice\". Well so are kitten videos on Youtube but should they be in the top spot of greatest movies ever made?Firstly its subject matter is crime and punishment. This is not a genre exempt from theatrical treatment, in musicals and such, but at least you know you are watching a fictitious romantic fantasy when the prisoners break out in song. There is no such device in Shawshank and here lies my problem with this movie. It simply does not in any way indicate that this is fantasy which it quite clearly is. It takes itself seriously and if you examine it seriously then it has serious flaws of deliberate making. If these were accidental then I could possibly forgive them but the fact is the audience is being manipulated like an episode of Little House on the Prairie. For those of you who do not remember it was one of the many tear-jerking TV shows in the 70s with Michael Landon (Lord have mercy on him). It is not that I am against tear-jerkers as such. I cried at the end of The Champ, like most. I can take my portion of treacle in measured doses. It is not that Shawshank is just sentimental. It is the fact that it masquerades as something else. To be fair this is not the fault of the actors. It is technically a very well made movie. The performances are very strong so I can understand its appeal on this level. However, even these positives do not mitigate the sins of the writer. I am a fan of Stephen King and I do enjoy his stories but this is definitely not one of them. Maybe it is because it is not all his doing. I never read the novella so I am not sure how much is his and how much came from the director/writer.There were many little stabs of: \"Is this for real?\" moments in this movie but the scene that really ended my engagement was the scene where Morgan Freedman is telling the other prisoners about institutionalization. This is done to the backdrop of a paroled prisoner hanging himself. The idea of Institutionalisation as a bad thing became popular in the 1990s when this movie was made and and it was simply inserted, like so many ideas lying about without any research or care for its accuracy. The fact we have an uneducated prisoner espousing a theory that had not even been researched just threw back the curtain on the manipulator of Oz and lost me forever. The fact that suicide was used as a sentimental tool to engage the viewer in such a sham and poorly considered way is simply unforgivable in my estimation.Good fiction is meant to engage and to some extent manipulate the audience but it should be believable and due care and consideration should be taken in the treatment and presentation of the story. When you feel the hand of the manipulator, or see the strings holding up the illusion then the spell is broken and the magic is gone. A great movie should have great acting, great production, great direction and writing. This one definitely does not have great writing. This movie is not what it aspires to be. I am not even sure that it knows what it is aspiring to be. It is not serious, not realistic but at the same time does not portray itself as fantasy. So what is it supposed to be and why do people rate it so highly? I have nothing against it but to think it is considered so great when it clearly is not is an insult to all the great writers. As a schmaltzy Sunday afternoon feel-good watch it could be considered good but Great? Come on! This Movie is a non event, at best. It is is a study in form with no substance. A pretty picture of a sentimental scene that never occurred and never will. A fantasy pretending it is something else. What, I just do not know. Can anyone tell me? \n",

Morgan freeman is locked up and i don't know he just acts like a kid in this. i understand he's suppose to be locked up since he was a teen but really he's giving the same performance here as his role as god in Bruce almighty. even though he's miscast he honestly carries the movie, mainly because Tim robins does nothing in this movie. some other subplots include Tim teaching some idiot to read or something, some old guy hangs himself, they deck a roof,freeman sneaks in a hammer and robins makes chess pieces, i'll stop the the point i'm making is this movie is excruciatingly boring. number one on IMDb, are you kidding me? even from a technical standpoint this movie blows. everything is just dull and unimpressive, hell it looks more like a TV movie than a film. i'd describe the tone of this as Disney's take on jail movies. it's to concerned with being safe and classy to accurately represent prison life. everyone's favorite part of this is the ending, and that sucked too. Tim robins apparently escapes prison with a rock hammer, after digging through his cell wall for like twenty years. his hiding place is a poster? really? to make matters more hilarious he has crawls through a tunnel of poop and emerges from a poop lake in a failed attempt to move the audience. Morgan freeman gets paroled by basically insulting the judges, than he goes to a rock in some random place that Tim told him to visit, and than goes to Mexico and finds Tim on a boat. reunited and roll credits, oh yeah Morgan freeman also married his step- granddaughter. that's the dumbest ending ever written. there's so much better stuff you could be watching instead of shawshank like porn or riki-oh. \n",

I simply cannot understand why it features so highly in many top movie listings. Yes the story is good and has a nice happy ending.

This unchallenging hackneyed dichotomy is helped by Andy's buddies vs the nasty gang who's leader is intent on a slightly different kind of relationship with Andy.The actors all shine and it's well photographed but is simply nothing special, it certainly doesn't warrant it's apparent stellar position in film history.

The poster never got touched in the dozen years he had it up? He openly talks of his geology skill and his knowledge of cutting rock, and the guards/warden/convicts never saw a 'red flag'?This is just an overly sentimental, Vaseline around the lens 'bow of the Titanic moment' movie, with no wit, grit or heart.

It just isn't a normal prison break story; a very deep implicit definition is buried in every scene of it. The main theme is the presence and the belief in hope by the main character of the story, Andy Dufresne. Repeatedly saying \"hope is a good thing\", Andy finally gets what he always wanted: an escape and a new start in the Pacific, something that was always described as impossible by the other prisoners. I guess that the element that triggered the viewers' attention the most was the optimism and mysterious character of Andy Dufresne. Watching the movie, we weren't really able to read what was going on his mind even though we had implicit clues of the clever and beautiful things he kept to himself. The choice of Tim Robbins as the main persona was well thought by Frank Darabont as he doesn't show a lot of emotions on his face. The bond that connected the inmates, especially Red and Andy was very strong, leading to sacrifices and promises. The friendship between the two men lasts beyond the walls of Shawshank and finds itself reincarnated in Zihuatanejo, the country with no memory. Another thing that strikes the spectators is the enjoyment and the love of the small things in life. This concept was seen in the \"opera music scene\", where the beauty of the music and the voices of the Italian ladies went past the skins and through the souls of the prisoners. The excitement felt by all these men was the only pleasing element that wasn't taken from them in this dangerous place. The most important piece of The Shawshank Redemption was the message that inspired all the movie lovers: every man has value and importance in the world. This message personally helped me slide away from my negative attitude and helped me enjoy every moment of life. For this incredible adaptation of \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" by Stephen King, I would like to gratefully thank Frank Darabont sharing his work of art to the world. \n",

      "SPOILER AHEAD, DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARNED. Andy Dufresne is a banker convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. The message that the movie tries to pass is that hope can set you free. It talks about Andy and his friends that lives in jail for a long time, and how Andy became \"successful\" even at jail. Andy knows that his place isn't in there, he dosn't consider himself guilty for the murder of his wife and her lover, he don't even tries to defend himself in the court, so when he's in jail he seems to be so peaceful and tranquilized that the other prisoners thinks he's spoiled, and he suffers from that from time to time because some queers liked him and frequently spanked and raped him. Andy also became friend with the director of the jail and the guard, using his banker skills to help them, but in return he asks for his friends to be treated nicely. Andy has a lot of hobbies, he's affectionate for stones, and he likes to play chess to, but he favorite hobby was dropping rests of what he toked of his wall inside his cell, he toked 20 years to make the entire tunnel and scape, of course he wouldn't leave his friend Red, behind with nothing, he told what the future reserved for them and told him where to look for it. For me the high level of the movie was at the end when they reveal Andy's plan, but it's so complex that I think that you would rather just go and watch the movie. One of my favorite movies of all time. \n",

During the film, you start to love the prisoners, because you get to know them more and more.I think this isn't the GREATEST movie ever, but it sure as hell is a good movie. I'd rate it a 8 or an 8,5.I like the fact too they show you how the prisoners react when their prison time is over. I find it hard to imagine how i'd feel if i was locked for 50 years. And a happy ending always makes me feel allot better.. although it is a bit dull. \n",

Its all about a man called Andy Dufresne falsely accused of murder of his wife and her lover and is sent to shawshank prison where he is beaten by the guards and other prisoners. Eventually he makes a friend called Red and fits in with Red. Andy was a smart banker before prison and used his brains to help the other prisoners like solving the guards tax problems then the wardens. Andy finds a way to escape from the prison by digging a hole and using a poster of Rita Hayworth to cover the hole(That is why the short story is called Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption) Andy escapes but before escaping he told Red to look under a tree when he leaves. Red leaves and finds that Andy under a fake name living in Mexico. The two meet for the first time in years and shake hands. The Shawshank Redemption starts and ends Fascinating. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is one of the finest examples of Stephen King's work adapted to the big screen. If not THE finest. Based on a short story from King's novella Different Seasons, it may be that rare thing where its a film that actually improves upon its source material. The story, of a man wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of his wife and her lover made for an interesting read, but it made for an even better film.Although TSR was nominated for seven Academy Awards, it didn't win a single one. Most of them went to the completely overrated Forrest Gump, including Best Picture and Best Actor. I think that was one of the Academy's darkest days.Despite the fact TSR did next to no business in 1994, it quickly gathered word of mouth afterwards, and went on to a healthy afterlife on video and TV. But that's not all. It slowly worked its way into the hearts and minds of people the world over, and today it's regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. Even a true American classic. And its even No 2 on the IMDb top 250. Beating out Forrest Gump by a significant margin!TSR is also one of the few films in the world that actually deserves all the acclaim it receives. I really loved this movie. I loved everything about it. The theme of maintaining hope in the face of crushing despair could have made for Hallmark TV movie material, but in the hands of first time director Frank Darabont, he's created an utter masterpiece.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, the man who allegedly did the crime. He is convicted and ordered to serve two consecutive life sentences in Shawshank State Prison. Robbins' performance is interesting if you've seen the one other really good film he made in 1994, The Hudsucker Proxy. There he played a bumbling, doltish fool. His work in TSR is a jarring about face.He completely downplays his emotions to the point of resigned dourness. Its quite a shocking thing to watch. But as good as Robbins' performance is, what makes it that all the more special is Andy's character is opened up not by him, but by an external character.Morgan Freeman, in arguably the best performance of his career plays Red, the prison fixer. He can get things for any inmate. Whether it be cigarettes, or a rock hammer. He is the narrator of the picture, and it is through his words that the world of Shawshank becomes a harsh and frightening reality.He knows the ins and outs of the prison system. When new inmates arrive, he can usually tell which ones won't last. He knows your first night at Shawshank is the worst. New inmates have to endure the catcalls and taunts of their cellmates. Red pegged Andy as the one who would break first. But he never did.Red freely admits he didn't think much of Andy at first. But slowly, the two men become acquaintances, and much later, friends. Morgan Freeman's resigned, soothing voice illuminates the harsh surroundings of the prison walls. The scariest thing about the prison was the Sisters. Sadistic prisoners who turned gay while locked up, and try to convert others. First through suggestion. And if that fails, force. Andy was their favourite target. And he had to endure rapes and beatings for his first two hellish years at Shawshank.Andy's background as an investment banker brings him to the attention of Warden Norton. Norton is a hypocritical tyrant. He claims to be a devout Christian, but he won't tolerate any challenges to his authority. Any who do wind up in solitary. For months at a time if necessary. Norton has Andy secure funds he has embezzled. And in exchange, Andy can procure funds for a new library and even beers for his fellow inmates. As long as he does exactly what Norton tells him to.The Shawshank Redemption resonates on many different levels as it tells many different stories. One of the most poignant is the plight of Brooks, an elderly inmate. Imprisoned for years, when he finally makes parole, he is terrified. Life at Shawshank has become the only life he's ever known. Once released, he knows he'll never survive out there. And he's right. The world has gone and changed on him. And life as a grocery bagger is no life at all. So he hangs himself. Its a haunting story. And one that never fails to choke me up inside.That situation extends to Red too. In Shawshank, he has a purpose. He is respected, valued, needed. Parole is not much different than a death sentence. He gets rejected for parole frequently over the course of 30 years. And he couldn't be happier.The most wrenching thing of all is Andy's apparent deterioration. He believes in hope. And tries to inspire some in his cellmates when he plays Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro over the PA system. That scene is a joyful moment to behold, with the men in the yard transfixed by the music. And Norton punishes him for his defiance. Andy seems to reach breaking-point when he confesses to Red he might as well have murdered his wife, because he didn't show her enough love and affection.It seems Norton has finally broken Andy. But when Andy escapes, its a triumphal moment. That famous scene, after Andy crawls 500 yds through a sewage pipe, standing in a downpour, relishing his first taste of freedom. It will send your spirits sky-high.Things end appropriately with Andy and later Red gaining freedom, on a secluded island. I love the way the camera observes their reunion from a distance. After their souls have been laid to bear, they deserve some privacy. One of the defining pictures of our generation. An experience I love to re-visit over and over.Magnificent! \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a gripping masterpiece that should not be missed by anyone. Andy Dufrense keeps us in suspense the entire way with his mysterious attitude to prison life and his claim that he is innocent. Tim Robbins performs excellently. Morgan Freemans role as Red telling the story was also quite an interesting touch. When I hired this film my expectations were not that it would become one of my favorite movies of all time. Guys definitely this is something you have to see for yourself and you will be categorically satisfied. Many unexpected twists and turns and actually quite plausible considering the time it's set in. I found myself on the edge of my seat almost the entire way. There are many touching and feel good scenes also particularly when Andy and his friends share a few beers in the sun on the roof after dealing his superior and for a few moments feel like free men. Fantastic film check it out if you haven't seen it re-watch if you have. 5 stars. \n",

      "Frank Darabont's beautiful adaptation of Stephen King's RITA HAYWORTH AND SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is an experience to remember for life. Tim Robbins is Andy Dufresne and is sent to prison in New England for murdering his wife and her lover. Morgan Freeman is Red, the man in prison who can get things for you. Together, they forge a lasting friendship as Andy's hope helps penetrate the thick walls in Shawshank prison, in more ways than one.Andy's first few years at Shawshank are filled with beatings and molestation's by a group of cretins called the \"Sisters.\" The leader is a man named Bogs who gives slime balls a good name. Sometimes Andy fights them off but as Red points out, \"Prison is no fairy tale world.\" Red arranges for his friends and Andy to tar the roof of the plate factory giving them all a nice rest from the prison walls. Red is definitely a man with connections. Clancy Brown is the picture of cruelty as the head of the guards named Byron Hadley. Andy overhears Hadley complaining about how the government is gonna take a nice chunk from his brother's inheritance. Andy informs Hadley how he could keep most of his brother's inheritance by allowing a tax free gift to his wife. Hadley nearly throws him off the roof but manages to hear him out. Andy sets up the papers for him in exchange for getting Red and his friends three beers a piece. To everyone's surprise Hadley agrees. This wins Andy a lot of friends especially when one offers him a beer and he tells him he's quit drinking.The warden gets wind of Andy's accounting skills and realizes he can use him to do his taxes. Andy gets a vicious beating from Bogs and the \"Sisters\" but this time Hadley beats Bogs to a pulp, crippling him and having him drinking through a straw for the rest of his life. Bogs is transferred out and the \"Sisters\" never touch Andy again.When Andy returns he finds the poster of Rita Hayworth he asked Red for. It comes with a note that says \"Free of Charge.\" Red and his friends are happy Andy is back and well. The Warden, played chillingly by Bob Gunton as greed personified, transfers Andy into the library and out of the laundry where Andy worked and endured beatings the first couple of years.Andy soon becomes an assistant to Brooks, an old prisoner nicely played by James Whitmore. Brooks cares for a bird named Jake and is well liked by Red and his friends. Later, Brooks is released and finds he's institutionalized and can't make it in the real world. Sadly, he kills himself and this worries Red more than anyone because he's constantly rejected by the Parole Board and fears being institutionalized.Andy sends out many letters requiring more funding for the library, with the permission of the warden, and gets it converted into a beautiful place in memory of Brooks. There, Andy helps many prisoners get their Higschool education's.Andy helps one man in particular out, a young thief named Tommy, that Red and his friends like as well. Later, Red and Andy find out that man spent time in prison with the real man who killed Andy's wife and her lover. Andy tells the warden and the warden has Hadley shoot Tommy to death.Andy is now trapped helping the corrupt Warden with all his dirty money. He confides in Red and tells him he wants to spend the rest of his life on an island in the pacific. Red tells him not to think like that but Andy gives Red instructions to find something of his when he gets out. Red promises too but is worried about Andy. Andy says his choice is ,\"Get busy living or get busy dying.\" The rest you can find out for yourself in this thought provoking and perfectly acted film. This is not just some prison movie but a movie about the harsh realities of confinement, the choices we make in our life, and of having hope despite the worst circumstances.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have never been better as well as the supporting cast. William Sadler does a nice job as Heywood, the Hank Williams loving friend who thinks a book in the library is called THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISCO.Frank Darabont directs this film so well you truly hate for it to end. Roger Deakins Cinematography is epic and inspiring and Thomas Newman's score finds just the right mood. This film is one of those you turn on in the middle of and just watch to the end, an incredibly deep and moving experience. \n",

This movie tells a story of a man who was left to die for something he never did, and how he takes what is given to him, and creates a intellectual paradise for himself and fellow inmates. Being such a genius, he is able to cover all his bases knowing that all of it could come crashing down, and it did. He makes a thought impossible escape, exposes his biggest enemy for what he is, and takes all his money which rightfully belongs to him anyway. It is a genius script and both actors are in my top 10. I love this movie, and it's second to none as it takes the most important aspects of film-making and owns all other movies at them.

      "'The Shawshank Redemption' may be hard to convince somebody to watch, but it's important to make sure everyone does. A prison movie is not the way it should be classified because 'The Shawshank Redemption' is a story about people. It is told through a prison and the idea that would be a cliché in any other film, hope. So, hope no longer becomes a cliché because it is realistic in Shawshank. Thus, people and their motives and environments make films interesting, realistic, influential, and memorable. And because Frank Darabont found a way to get all of these elements into the greatest film ever made, people who see 'The Shawshank Redemption' look at life at a whole new perspective. That being to \"Get busy living, or get busy dying\", and to always have hope. \n",

      "Spoiler!! The philosophical ebbs and flows of The Shawshank Redemption make it the finest movie of the last ten years. Andy is a ping pong ball of hope and despair, of assimilation and rejection.  The same is true of Red, but the philosophical contrast between the two, and the way each is forced to consider the other's viewpoint, is why this movie's message is so poignantly delivered.Andy, in his earliest prison days, is a loner, whose hope that his nightmarish incarceration will not prove real delays his assimilatation into the culture and society of Shawshank.  Ultimately, though, while clinging to an inner belief that Shawshank is not home, he realizes that, in assimilation, lies his only hope of coping with prison life.Contrastingly, Red, a long-term inmate whose once-a-decade parole rejections have become a ritual reminder of the fact that he has no hope of getting out of prison, has assimilated to the fullest possible extent, and clearly views Shawshank as home.Each is frequently exposed to the viewpoint of the other.  Red expresses concern when Andy dreams of life in Mexico, but Andy takes exception when Red proclaims himself to be dependent on Shawshank for his livelihood. Red, in essence, suggests that Andy accept Shawshank as home.Red is selling despair and assimilation to Andy, but Andy is selling hope and rejection to Red.  When Andy escapes from Shawshank, Red's chance to sell Shawshank to Andy evaporates, but it's impossible to tell whether Andy has reached Red or not, and it appears that it doesn't really matter.The brilliant twist toward the end of The Shawshank Redemption is that it is the manifestation of his despair to the parole board that results in Red's parole.  Even in parole, however, Red finds despair in assimilation, the same despair that prompted Brooks to commit suicide some years earlier. Only when he reads the note Andy left for him in the hayfields of Buxton is Red presented with a chance to pursue a course of hope and rejection.Rejection, in this case, means parole violation, and results directly from Red's, seemingly unprecedented, hope for a happy life.  When Red acts on his impulse and travels to Mexico to, presumably, live out his life alongside the greatest friend he has ever known, he, finally, buys into Andy's philosophies about hope, despair, assimilation and rejection.\n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a simple story elegantly, cleverly told, not to mention expertly acted. The story is about a banker (Tim Robbins), wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her lover, who finds the strength to deal with the brutality of prison, thanks to a murderer serving a life term.The film is a tense drama of injustice and male dignity, brilliantly adapted from Stephen King's story, with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their peak. A satisfying, audience-pleasing film. It has enjoyed a curious after-life. On its release in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption had mixed reviews and grossed just $28 million in the US; it did not make the list of Top 50 films at the box-office for that year. Yet in 2001, Channel 4 TV viewers voted it their third favourite film of all time, behind only the Star Wars and Godfather films.

Because of the way it plays on me, I can't help but give it a 10. Here's why: First off, the acting. Tim Robbins is SO subtle that he strikes me as a person that tries to bury his innocence, because in reality it does not matter. Few would argue that Morgan Freeman is brilliant, as usual. But here the supporting cast throws in with equally impressive performances.The Score. Outside the music from the records appearing in the movie, the relatively unrestrictive score just helps us confirm what our eyes see, the walls of Shawshank.

      "Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free. A good tagline for a great prison drama from writer/director Frank Darabont (The Green Mile), based on the book by Stephen King. Basically Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is the lawyer convicted for the murder of his wife, sent to Shawshank prison, headed by the nasty Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). While he is there he is quiet for a while, but eventually he forms a friendship with black Irish marketeer Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Morgan Freeman, and the character was originally a white red haired Irishman), retains hope and gains respect of fellow inmates. After a while, he gets to do a lot of personal work for the Warden sorting documents, founding a new library and improving a lot of other things, with his law and mathematical skills. One day though, he seems strange towards Red when he asks him to find a specific tree somewhere he knows, and the next morning, he has escaped (scraping through the soft wall with a chisel). Andy and Red do eventually find each other again in the happy emotional ending, well, many moments in the film are emotional. It was a flop in the cinemas, and since release to video and DVD it has become a favourite with many film goers. Also starring William Sadler as Heywood, Clancy Brown as Captain Byron T. Hadley, Gil Bellows as Tommy and James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Thomas Newman, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Morgan Freeman was number 27 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the scene where classical operatic music plays in the prison, it was number 23 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, it was number 13 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, and it was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Films.

      "It seems that every time a movie comes out with an exceedingly positive and uplifting message or story, the average moviegoer is blind to any other problems or shortcomings the film might have. Every moment of this film feels phony and hollow. The character of Red (Morgan Freeman) is just a vehicle to keep the plot moving and doesn't seem to even exist as a whole person. His narration is embarrassing with its phony regional dialect and forced folksiness. The prison life depicted, while brutal and violent in a few scenes, is overromanticized by the picturesque cinematography and florid music. The plot is fairly clever but, like bad American television, everything that happens is in service of the plot. There's no behavior from the characters that doesn't help bring you to the film's stunningly maudlin final scene. And there are logistical problems, like the fact that you can't make a hole in a thick metal sewer pipe by hitting it with a rock three times. They could have solved this problem by just showing a shot of a clock moving forward. The best character is a relatively brief and peripheral one, Brooks (James Whitmore). Whitmore doesn't seem to know he's in such a shallow, contrived movie and gives the character a realism and three-dimensionality the other characters don't have in his short time on screen. In the montage-type scene in which he's trying to cope with life out of prison, however, he suddenly seems less intelligent and more of a stereotype of a befuddled old man. Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne is somewhere between good and mediocre, seeming to force weird expressions onto his face like he just read the character description in the script for the first time. Bob Gunton as Warden Norton is over-the-top and seemingly one-dimensional, but it works because Bible-thumpers are often over-the-top and seemingly one-dimensional. He's actually believable and interesting to watch. The prison guard Hadley (Clancy Brown) is realistically sadistic, but his type of comically crude sexual language sounds too contemporary for the time. The final scene is just so unrealistically over-the-top happy and sunny it's an insult to the viewer's intelligence and, I think, ruins much of the film. This film obviously has developed a huge following over the years, but I think that's largely just because of it's sentiment of hopefulness and positivity, and that doesn't necessarily indicate a well-written, well-executed, well-acted film. Some of the worst crap in theatres and on television has a hopeful, inspiring, uplifting message. Of course a film doesn't have to depict a realistic world. In fact, I like surrealism in movies. But it should at least show an interesting version of a world, and to keep any intelligent viewer's attention the characters have to be fully realized, seemingly existing in a world outside of the film's plot. \n",

      "Just having registered with IMDb, I thought a good movie to start my reviewing with would be the one which users have rated the best of the best. This is one of my favorite films & over the years I have watched it or portions of it whenever it happening to be playing on TV, probably mustering up a good 20-30 viewings to the point that I thought I could nearly recite the films dialogue word for word. That anyone could rate any film 10 out of 10 I figure is more a function of the mind of the viewer, and its penchant for exaggeration after watching a film which happens to induce some powerful emotions in him, rather than any inherent perfection in the piece. Whatever the truth may be I offer here some reasons why this particular film, although moving and well made in it's own right, cannot be the best film made by the hands of man.#6: It seemed to me that the evidence for convicting Andy at the beginning was badly inadequate. There was no murder weapon found & no prints of his found inside the building the murders took place. His story was consistent, and though he had motive for getting wasted and driving around, its a big step to murder, and what guilty man freely admits he had a gun and planned on using it to scare the adulterers, when on trial for his life? An upright, honest man with faith and trust in the judicial system, thats who. Small wonder he was so shocked to here the judge give his sentence. And who was Andy's lawyer, Lionel Hutz?, did they not dust the murder scene for prints to give an idea of a possible involvement from another party etc?#5: The night he decides to escape just happens to be a stormy one with loud peals of thunder perfectly disguising his rocking the sewage line? c'mon!#4: The guy has been in the same cell for 19 years. All the time an enormous poster has been draped over the subway tunnel like hole to freedom he has been digging away at each night. No guard in that span felt he might have a curious peek-a-boo under the poster during the cell checks?#3: I was a little incredulous at the good faith the warden seemed to show Andy after he had completed his 2nd warden ordered ordeal in the hole. \"Its good to have you back Andy, place has'nt been the same without you\" Did the warden remember putting Andy in the hole in the 1st place, for pleading and proving his innocence to him, remember having the man shot who could have restored Andy's life, I thought a man smart enough to contrive all of the fraudulent operations that were making the warden rich would at least merit a small deal of suspicion from the warden. \"what else might this man be capable of?\"#2: Andy's job on the outside was as a banker not a priest, the movie continues to show how clever he is and flexible at making the most of his limited resources in the joint, but when and how did he find time to memorize that enormous book that is the bible? passage for passage, line for line? his mastery of this difficult book is shown in giving the exact chapter and line reference after the warden quotes him a segment of the book. Perhaps that is why his wife wanted to leave him, after work he was up all night till 4am memorizing segments of the bible, but more likely not.#1: Finally and I thought most implausibly, the new guy Andy taught to read and write just happened to have the information on the \"real killer\" For this to happen I thought the following chance happenings would have to conspire: 1: he happens to share a cell with the killer at some other prison 2: the killer chooses to tell him that he killed a couple & a banker got the blame for it 3: he finds himself in another prison where Andy resides 4: of the many convicts, he happens to form a friendship with red and Andy and their small crew 5: red happens to spill the beans about Andy's crime to him I thought all this was a little unlikelyIn summary, great movie, great dialogue, excellent performances, and great vindication of the power of hope, the rewards of perseverance and the importance of sticking to ones core values regardless of external circumstances, not the best of the best, but what is? 7 out of 10 \n",

      "Let me start by stating that this is one of the most sad, poignant and beautiful films I've seen since Paranormal Entity. I feet that Tom Hanks' portrayal of a bored police officer was cutting edge at the time and has yet to be surpassed by any actor in any film since, excluding Shane Van Dyke's potentially career defining performance in Shane Van Dyke's Paranormal Entity (written by Shane Van Dyke). Michael Clarke Duncan's interpretation of the character John Cofey was banal to say the least, but I was more than compensated for this error in judgement with two deliciously witty comedy set pieces. One was where a rat got knocked out and one was where he forgot to put a sponge on his head. As an aside, I enjoyed the skit in which Michael Clarke Duncan refused to give Moon's Sam Rockwell a slice of bread and the bit where Tom Hanks couldn't take a wazz.In conclusion, I award this film 2 golden skulls. Half a star for the scene where the rat dies, and one star for Tim Robins crawling through a crapper. I am also awarding the film two golden skulls for the scene in which Tom Hanks bangs his wife after John Cofey heals him.Overall - 3 golden skulls (Paranormal Entity earned 9 golden skulls) cheers \n",

      "this is the best movie i seen till yet One of the greatest of all war films, Klimov's stunning work stands amongst such works in which the horror and sorrow of conflict are made fresh over again for the viewer, left to stumble numb from the cinema thereafter. Produced for the 40th anniversary of Russia's triumph over the German invaders in WW2, based upon a novella by a writer who was a teenage partisan during the war, the propagandist use to which it was later put - when the GDR was still in the Eastern Bloc, citizens were forced to watch this to warn them of another rise of fascism - does not impair its effect today at all. It echoes intensity found in another masterpiece by the director. Klimov's shorter Larissa (1980) is a remorseful elegy to his late wife. Poetic and very personal, its sense of shock anticipates the heightened anguish that ultimately reverberates through Come And See. Through his images, the director stares uncomprehendingly at a world where lives are removed cruelly and without reason, if on this occasion not just one, but thousands. \n",

It's an above-average prison film that's well-acted - but it's nothing special. It's slow and too long. Many fans of this film claim that it's a feel-good film - an uplifting story about friendship and mental strength. Some even claim that watching it can cure depressed viewers. However, it's a heavy-going film that includes beatings and rape.We never find out whether or not the protagonist committed the double murder that he's imprisoned for, which is a crucial point as a viewer.

      "The first time I viewed Shawshank Redemption I didn't find it to be anything special. Sure, stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were good BUT their performances weren't anything special...or so I thought at the time.Frank Darabont directs Shawshank Redemption with a gentle, guiding hand allowing the actors to discover the essence within their characters. Some actors, undoubtedly, would not be up to the task. Robbins and Freeman, however, are not \"some actors.\" They are consummate actors and masterful in their portrayals here.Based upon Stephen King's novella, Darabont creates a film that never buys into the drama of its story, instead choosing to present the lives of the characters involved without histrionics. I have long felt, in fact, that the film may even improve upon the novella by bringing it into focus and providing it with a pacing that allows a more explicit character development.I have noticed that many of my favorite films are ensemble pieces, and while Robbins and Freeman shine here it is actually the entire cast that brings this story to life with such grace and beauty. Supporting performances by the likes of James Whitmore, William Sadler, Gil Bellows and others who take what could be caricatures and give them in-depth personalities and thoughts and feelings.Thomas Newman's score is supremely divine and changes along with the characters. It further enhances Darabont's pacing, as well. There are so many memorable scenes in Shawshank Redemption, however, the closing scene is certainly among one of the best closing scenes ever witnessed.It is hard to fathom that a \"prison\" movie could be a source of tremendous hope, light and inspiration. Yet, to call Shawshank Redemption a prison movie is to minimize its greatness. It is a brilliant film, a study of humanity in all its wonder AND it happens to take place within the confines of a prison.Moving, brilliant, inspirational, hopeful and empowering are all words that describe \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" With outstanding performances from its ensemble cast and a work of tremendous cinematic poetry by director Frank Darabont. \"Shawshank Redemption\" creates a stellar vision that teaches, challenges, inspires and evokes a wide array of emotions and thoughts that serves to remind us that in the darkest moments of our lives there is always a light that shines within. \n",

Strictly speaking, Shawshank is not 'redemption', because after all what did the guy need redeeming 'from'? He was innocent. It is basically a giant metaphor for a journey from an entrapped and miserable existence to a beautiful promised land. It is set as a prison story, but really symbolizes any arena of life where one may feel hopeless and desperate to get out of a seemingly impossible situation.Beautifully written with a host of engaging characters, where for once the good are equally as interesting as the bad. I always find it curious that in many prison dramas when the guards, especially the warden, are the bad guys whereas the inmates (criminals, we assume) are the good. At least the protagonists are. Take Escape from Alcatraz as another example. I wonder what this says about our society and the concept of good and evil we have deep down? I believe it's a closet hatred of authority in general.

On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success.

Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW.

      "The Shawshank Redemption follows Andy Dufresne, a banker accused of the murder of his wife and her lover. In prison, he meets an inmate Ellis \"Red\" Redding, who Dufresne befriends. Redding is the narrator of the movie talking about his past experience at Shawshank. Over the 19 year period that the movie takes place, Red and Dufresne grow closer, and the tale follows tragic losses of friends, corruption of the prison's staff, and a great escape. This movie is a great movie for those who like a 'justice served' type movie as well as a well written one. In general, foreshadowing indicates that the story is well written enough to the point where the writers can make a reference to the future about what is going to happen. In one scene, Dufresne is carving names into the walls in his cell block. The scene then shifts to Dufresne asking Red if he can acquire a poster (because Red is the guy who can 'get things' in prison). Throughout the entire movie, every scene in Dufresnes cell shows that poster. At the end of the movie it is revealed that the poster hanging on the wall was used to cover a hole that Dufresne had been digging since the night he was carving the names in the wall. He accidentally discovered how flimsy the walls were, and realized he could tunnel out. This makes the movie good because the scenes leading up to the end hinted at the fact that there was something special about the poster, however the audience was never sure. When it was revealed at the end, the audience can make the connection between that night he asked for the poster and the scene where the hole is discovered. Andy Dufresne is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, however it is never actually revealed if he did it or not. The movie goes along hinting that Dufresne is innocent and although it is never confirmed, I found myself trusting the fact that he did not do it. Throughout the movie, Dufresne is treated very poorly, such as being used to launder money for the prison due to his banking background. So when news comes in of a new inmate who confessed to Dufresne crime, Dufresne tries to convince the Warden that he is innocent and demands a retrial or probation. The Warden denies him but at a cost; Dufresne escapes and reveals the corruption at Shawshank causing the Warden to commit suicide to avoid arrest. In general, people who pity Dufresne in his position would feel that he won in the end, escaping the prison and revealing the warden's corruption. This is enjoyable because it has a sense of karma, where because the warden treated Dufresne so poorly, he got fooled in the end. Therefore, this movie is a good movie for people who enjoy social justice type movies, because Dufresne beat the Warden and escaped the prison, as well as for people who enjoy deep movies, that are well written, as demonstrated through the foreshadowing that the writers put into it. \n",

      "What an enjoyable movie The Shawshank Redemption turned out to be and a true classic. At first glance, the title immediately through me off. It honestly didn't seem like the type of movie I would like. As I got further into the movie however, the storyline began to catch my interest. Andy Dufresne is a well to do banker. He seems intelligent, somewhat corny and well to do. You can imagine my confusion as to how he winds up in prison. Through an interesting plot twist early on in the movie, it seems Andy is falsely accused of a horrendous crime and sentenced to time in prison. Right from the beginning he hits it off with Red, a black older gentleman who seems to be the go to man for everything. Throughout the film Red and Andy develop a loyal friendship that gets them both through the many years of imprisonment. While doing time Andy finds out that there is a way to prove his innocence and is hopeful that he will be released. After expressing that hope to Norton, the warden Andy realizes that he has no intention of helping him and that he would face many more years behind bars. This realization causes Andy to do the unthinkable and Right from the start I felt like the theme was going to be along the lines of hope, never giving up, make the most of your situation or never judge a book by its cover. Andy kept his cool and was hopeful that he would be 'redeemed' throughout most of the movie. You get the sense that he knew he would be proved innocent. He remained hopeful and helpful at all times similar to Pi in Life of Pi. From the beer that he finagled for the prisoners on that hot Summer day, books in the library that he requested and received and the assistance that he provided during tax time, he was definitely more than meets the eye. You honestly don't really expect the ending at all. I didn't really think he'd have that in him. This is a King film though so you know there will be unexpected plot twists.The setting completely made the movie. A drab prison in a remote location, a smelly sewage line and absolutely no grab just sets a tone for unpleasantry, seclusion and discontentment. Considering where Andy came from it was a complete contrast and definitely took some getting used to. Even the transformation of the library - an attempt from Andy in seeking normalcy, was completely realistic in that they took a barren prison room and created shelving, a similar dewey decimal system and structure. The costumes also played an important role within the film and worked hand in hand with the setting. All prisoners wear the same type of clothing and style. There are no stand outs. Some items were more worn than others and some just plain didn't fit well depending on the person. He helped to portray an idea of what it would really be like in prison.Ultimately the movie took a case of misfortune and showed based off circumstances, the lengths that someone would go when the odds are against them. The director also showed us that in the most unlikely places how a true friendship can blossom. Never giving up hope, never judging a book by it's cover. \n",

      "So, 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Where do I start? The 1994 prison drama based on the Steven King novella 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption', from his 1982 collection 'Different Seasons'. Andy Dufresne, a banker from Maine, is convicted for the double murder of his wife and her lover, a crime he did not commit. He is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary to serve a life sentence. There, he meets Red, a prisoner who smuggles items from the outside world. Andy, who had been an amateur geologist before being jailed, asks Red to get him a rock hammer for shaping rocks he collects from the exercise yard into small sculptures. One of the next items he orders from Red is a large poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the ensuing years, Andy regularly requests more posters from Red, including pin-ups of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. When asked, Andy tells Red that he likes to imagine he can step through the pictures and be with the actresses. So now you've got a basic overview; let's get into the protagonist and of this fictional prison tale - Andy Dufresnse. As previously stated, Andy is a banker from Maine. At first sight Andy comes across an icy and cold man, whilst in the court room; causing the viewer to lean towards deeming him guilty, rather than innocent. The saying 'Never judge a book by its cover' springs to mind in this instance. We find out Andy is a well educated and extremely crafty gentleman because of his ability to sculpt small rocks with a rock hammer, and his knack for self-education through reading books.A pivotal character in this films plot is Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding; of whom interestingly - is of Irish heritage; hence the last name 'Redding'. As you may have picked up his nickname is'Red and it is a play on words ofhis last name. He was sent to Shawshank Prison in Maine in 1927, because he planned and carried out his wife's murder by disabling her brakes which accidentally killed a neighbour and child as well, which earned him a life sentence at Shawshank Prison. In the film he is known as the 'guy who can get things' as he regularly smuggles many items into the prison with help from others. Also, a very craft and intelligent man.It is also an incredibly moving story, which makes you ponder what it'd be like to feel as trapped as the prisoners, and to feel the desperation they would have. Not to ruin the plot completely but 'Red' described himself as 'institutionalised', which made him feel like he'd struggle to exist outside the walls of Shawshank. To me, It's a powerful, poignant and thought-provoking film like no other; which truly has the ability to alter your outlook on life, and I believe it could change it in a positive way as it teaches you to be grateful for the life you have, as some others are much worse off than you are. I also admire the attention given to the story, which no other movie that I have watched has quite done. And that is why I consider it as one of my all-time favourites. \n",

The bad guys are bad and the good guys are good. There is no development to them, they are simply archetypes, and for film with the word 'redemption' in its title, there is no redemption to be shown. Morgan Freeman's character is redeemed from the start, and Tim Robbin's character has nothing to redeem for anyway - they are simply two characters lacking in depth who fail to grow throughout the film.There are points of the film that do have an emotional punch, and it is certainly a film worth watching, but it's far too shallow to be considered great. I have always felt as though I am watching an afternoon TV movie when I see this - it is a simple film, with simple characters that lacks in deep themes, ambiguity and development, instead opting to tell you everything through the (largely) unnecessary narration. Is Shawshank a good film? Yes, it is. Is it great? Absolutely not. \n",

      "think every generation has their films that they can relate to. My generation related to films like Breakfast Club, Pretty In Pink and Fasstimes at Ridgemont High. Not to say that these films cannot make an impression on today's youth, because I'm sure that they can, but they were definitely films that appealed to kids my age in the 80's. Napolean Dynamite is a film that, in my opinion, is much more of a film that appeals to today's youth. Napolean is a slacker and just wants to be left alone. He has his circle of friends but for the most part, as the poster says, he is out to prove that he has nothing to prove. The film is humorous in some parts, pedestrian in others and overall it is a film that for someone like me ( 33 years old ), it probably doesn't work as well as it does for someone who is in high school. I know many kids that enjoyed this film and most of it was because of Jon Heder. He embodies the very spirit of Napolean Dynamite and even though I found the film to quite average, I have to admit that even I enjoyed Heder's performance. He obviously has a bright future ahead of him with a total of 7 films to his credit in the next two years. \n",

      "great.....movie nice The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10 \n",

      "Christopher Nolan brings yet another adrenaline-filled, comic-inspired movie to the big screen. We see all sorts of familiar faces this time around, but the audience is introduced to a few new characters as well. When crisis threatens Gotham City, Bruce Wayne jumps back into the Batmobile to fight crime. Batman is joined on his quest by an eager orphaned cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a seductive cat burglar (Anne Hathaway), and a violent masked villain (Tom Hardy). This film served as great entertainment with its colorful cast and numerous plot twists. Nolan used actors that had either appeared in previous Batman films or in his blockbuster hit Inception, and all of them shone in their respective roles: Tom Hardy was almost unrecognizable in his Bane costume, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotillard were both excellentand obviously comfortable with Nolan's directing style and the film's dramatic tone. \n",

      "When I heard that this movie bombed at the box office during its theatrical run, I was very surprised as this is simply an all time classic. Rarely is narration in a movie been done as well as this, Morgan Freeman simply becomes Ellis Redding whose depiction of a hardened con who has accepted that he may never get out and goes through his parole hearings not caring about the outcome. Tim Robbins becomes Andy Dufresne and his portrayal of a man who is really out of his depth and his element, and finding adjusting to life on the inside difficult, almost impossible. The changing relationship between the two characters from initial hostility to deep almost brother like friendship is captivating. Clancy Brown's depiction of the tyrannical Captain Baron Hadley is amazing and likewise Bob Gunton as the hypocritical bible bashing, Warden Norton. The other characters like wise are also well done, especially Brooks and sadistic inmate Boggs. The depiction is what you'd expect from a prison movie and while depicting a life of boring monotony and routine show occasionally punctuated by brief moments of excitement is still fascinating thanks to the soundtrack and of course Morgan Freeman's narration, and I don't want to spoil the ending but it climaxes perfectly with not a dry eye in sight, thanks to the pacing, and the dialogue can't be faulted. Now in regard to the differences from the book, these are for the most part minor and if anything enhance the story rather than hinder it, a rarity. In summary this is a must watch for all movie lovers. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a fine and heartwarming tale that holds up after over 20 years. The film is about a man named Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) who is sentenced to prison after it is ruled he killed his wife. In my mind, The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best \"feel good\" movies because it is not afraid to present darker themes (suicide, rape, corruption, etc.) and explore the brutality of prison life. But by presenting such a low for the main characters, the audience feels more when the heroes succeed in the end. I feel that Andy is a character most people can empathize, which is critical for a movie of this type. In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is a solid film that leaves a good feeling with the viewer, even after the credits roll. \n",

After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.

      "The shaw shank redemption is undoubtedly a good film, no movement, no special effects, even no beauty, but still can impress the audience, and after more than ten years and charm. It depend on what attracted us? Some say because it reflects the toughness of the \"human nature\". Indeed, with a small hammer, nearly 20 years, the personal control is very strict fascist prison, unearthed a small escape tunnel (perhaps call hew to knock a small tunnel is more suitable, the hammer is too small). Isn't this resilience reflects the people? But I think the plot is dramatic obviously, this is just a director in the arrangement of the plot, at the end of this just in order to reflect the \"self-salvation\" Andy finally succeeded, otherwise the whole plot and theme. So some people think that, \"the shaw shank redemption\" reflect is actually \"hope\" is how valuable to the people. Yes, the film directly when it comes to have lots of hope. Such as Andy escaped prison after letter to Rhetta said: \"Remember, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing (dies.\" Maybe that's what works and director want to tell us. \"Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free.\" This sentence has become a famous. To me, \"the shaw shank redemption\" touched my place not only on this. Tell me about my ideas about the characters in the film first. A shark fort prison, the prisoners inside and officials, seems to be that our society. High above the warden NORTON, at ordinary times, on the lines, such as the bible actually gain by hook or by crook, cruel and cunning and greed. Guards long Haley and other officers, and vicious brutality, ACTS as NORTON's thugs, grass Jan the prisoner's life. They are like a power class in our reality? I call it a shark fort ruler of the \"small society\". There are different in the prisoners. Besides the protagonist Andy, Rhetta (Morgan Freeman) is a key figure, of course, I think he is a clue of the film: in fact, the whole movie dialogue is not much, in the film a lot of want to show the things is by Rhetta monologue, which were mostly Rhetta to shaw shank life reflection to summarize and his interpretation of Andy. Rhett is a wise man, and he in shark fort mix very well, make the demand of people he was less than \"no\". His wisdom and insight into the shark fort the essence of life, he said to Andy: \"the shark fort, hope is a dangerous thing\", this is the wise man's tongue. In my environment, people will say \"Rhetta comrade very sophisticated,\" at such a time. However, and the reality of the so-called \"wise men\", although Rhetta see see through the essence of the shark fort, but he didn't want to fight in the past, not to mention influence and change others, he is only conform to the rules in order to protect themselves in the shaw shank. Until Andy appear, changed his, and eventually lead him to the freedom of the other shore. \n",

It encompasses the reality of a prison thriving on corruption among its operators as Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the protagonist, struggles to serve a sentence wrongfully imposed on him. It seems the only thing helping him survive the harsh reality of prison is fellow inmate Red (Morgan Freeman) with whom he forms a special friendship. Life for Andy in a tough prison is set to last him all his life. If you're looking for a movie that will take you on an emotional roller coaster, or a tear-jerker, then this is the film for you.

Don't get me wrong the movie was great through every scene (especially small details, like how Red sees 'Brooks was here' carved into the ceiling of the room Brooks hangs himself in), but the moment you think you'll see Andy hanging lifeless from his cell you find out that he has escaped Shawshank. In the next moments while watching you start to realize that from the first day Andy talked to Red about the pick hammer, he already has his plan in mind. And even though it seems as if Andy wants the poster of the actress while watching the film for his own pleasure, he actually used it to cover up the tunnel he dug during the years he was in Shawshank. Andy's calm demeanor when under pressure from the warden and the guards causes him to slip under their eye and dig the tunnel to escape Shawshank. That's why this is my favorite movie of all time, because the conclusion makes you realize things that were going on throughout the story that no other movie ending can even come close to how the Shawshank Redemption ends. \n",

      "With a legion of titles like Pet Sematary, Firewalker, Sleepwalkers, Maximum Overdrive, and Children of the Corn, it's reasonable not to expect much from Stephen King-inspired motion pictures. Adaptations of the prolific author's work typically vary from mildly entertaining to virtually unwatchable. There are a few notable exceptions, however; two of which Stand by Me, Misery were crafted by widely-respected director Rob Reiner. While The Shawshank Redemption is not a Reiner movie per Se, it is a production of Castle Rock Pictures Reiner's film company, and ranks among the best filmed versions of any King stories to date. This statement has not changed since I first wrote it in 1994.Spanning the years from 1947 through 1966, The Shawshank Redemption takes the \"innocent man in prison\" theme and bends it at a different angle. Instead of focusing on crusades for freedom, the movie ventures down a less-traveled road, concentrating on the personal cost of adapting to prison life and how some convicts, once they conform, lose the ability to survive beyond the barbed wire and iron bars. As one of the characters puts it: \"These prison walls are funny. First you hate them, then you get used to them, then you start to depend on them.\"Filmed on location in a disused Ohio prison, The Shawshank Redemption is set in a place of perpetual dreariness. What little color there is, is drab and lifeless lots of grays and muted greens and blues, and there are times when the film is a shade away from black-and-white give credit to cinematographer Roger Deakins, a longtime Cohen brothers collaborator. It's ironic, therefore, that the central messages are of hope, redemption, and salvation.First time feature director Frank Darabont helms a fleet of impressive performances. Tim Robbins, as Andrew Dufresne, plays the wrongly convicted man with quiet dignity. Andy's ire is internal; he doesn't rant about his situation or the corruptness of the system that has imprisoned him. His unwillingness to surrender hope wins him the admiration of some and the contempt of others, and allows the audience to identify with him that much more strongly.Ellis Boyd Redding Morgan Freeman, or \"Red\" as his friends call him, is the self-proclaimed \"Sears and Roebuck\" of the Shawshank Prison for a price, he can get just about anything from the outside. His is the narrative voice and, for once, the disembodied words aid, rather than intrude upon, the story. Serving a life sentence for murder, Red is a mixture of cynicism and sincerity - a man with a good soul who has done a vile deed. His friendship with Andy is one of The Shawshank Redemption's highlights.William Sadler (as a fellow prisoner), Clancy Brown as a sadistic guard, and Bob Gunton as the corrupt warden all give fine supporting performances. Newcomer Gil Bellows, in a small but crucial role that was originally intended for Brad Pitt, brings the poise of a veteran to his portrayal of Tommy Williams, Andy's protégé.Ultimately, the standout actor is the venerable James Whitmore, doing his finest work in years. Whitmore's Brooks is a brilliantly realized character, and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of Shawshank represents one of the film's most moving - and effective - sequences.Unfortunately, following a solid two hours of thought-provoking drama, the movie deflates like a punctured balloon during its overlong denouement. The too-predictable final twenty minutes move a little slowly, and writer/director Darabont exposes a distressing need to wrap up everything into a tidy little package.\"Salvation lies within,\" advises Warden Norton at one point. It is the presentation of this theme that makes The Shawshank Redemption unique. Prison movies often focus on the violence and hopelessness of a life behind bars. While this film includes those elements, it makes them peripheral. The Shawshank Redemption is all about hope and, because of that, watching it is both uplifting and cathartic. \n",

      "It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (\"looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over\"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison. \n",

Andy asks for two things; a small rock hammer and Rita Hayworth! Soon after Red provides him with one rock hammer and a large poster featuring Rita Hayworth. Life in Shawshank is not easy; the guards are brutal and some of the inmates are worse. Andy survives though and things get better when he is able to help the meanest of the guards avoid paying tax on an inheritance; soon he is acting as accountant to the whole prison and helping the corrupt warden squirrel away large sums of money earned by prison labour. He is able to use this position to improve the life of prisoners too; a few beers for a work party, improvements to the prison library and education for some inmates. All the time Andy professes his innocence then one day after he has spent almost twenty years behind bars a young man comes to Shawshank; the man tells the story of how a cellmate at a previous prison claimed to have murdered a man and the woman he was with leaving her banker husband to take the blame. Andy believes this may finally get him out of prison but there is no way the warden will let him go; he is too useful and he knows too much",
      " that won't stop Andy though.This film, based on a Stephen King short story, is rightfully considered a classic. There are no scenes that felt unnecessary from start to finish the story moves at a good pace. We see both the good and the bad inside the prison; there are scenes of brutality but also scenes of joy such as watching the prisoners enjoy the simple pleasure of having a cold beer of a scorching day",

There is also the joy of seeing that Andy will not break and his greatest triumph coming just as it looks as if he has finally reached breaking point. The cast does a great job; Tim Robbins is great as Andy and the always reliable Morgan Freeman is on top form as Red; theirs is one of the great portrayals of a screen friendship. It isn't just the likable characters who are well acted though; Bob Gunton is subtly unpleasant as the hypocritical Warden; quoting scripture one minute profiteering, and much worse, the next; Clancy Brown is also great as the truly unpleasant Captain Hadley; the senior guard who brutalises the inmates. After the suffering inside the finale chapter where we see Andy's escape and revenge makes this a feel-good movie despite what we've seen before. This is definitely a must see film. \n",

      "It has long been my contention that it is the movie-maker's task to hold the viewer's attention, not to burden him with his self-indulgent, difficult-to-follow symbolisms. That having been said, I find it difficult to find another movie I would recommend more highly than The Shawshank Redemption. Without any high- adrenaline action sequences or steamy sex scenes (two sure-fire ways to get the viewer's attention), this film somehow has the power to make you sit through all 142 minutes without for a moment getting bored. And I challenge anyone who has seen it to delete any scene, even any minute, from the final edit. The fact is, you can't. Because every single scene is an essential element that contributes to the final result: a masterpiece that captures the drama of enduring friendship and resiliency of the human spirit more powerfully than any other film ever made. Even those who normally do not watch movies with a critical eye will find themselves so drawn into this experience. I really can't say enough about this film. Suffice it to say that this is certainly the Greatest Movie Not to Win an Oscar. (Since Citizen Kane, at least. )Actually, I can forgive the Film Academy for not honoring this film with the Oscars I firmly believe it deserved. But when the American Film Institute in 1998 put together their list of The 100 Greatest Movies of all time (covering the period from 1896-1996), and so myopically overlooked Shawshank in favor of such titles as Rocky, Dr. Strangelove, Network, and Jaws, well, I thought that was absolutely ridiculous.I wouldn't hesitate to put it in the top five of all time. \n",

The two become inseparable as they deal with prison life and the guards betting the HELL out of some of the prisoners; one got killed to death by the guard while the other hanged himself to death.Everyday they have to dig up holes and eating disgusting food, but will Andy(aka Robbins)ever get out of prison and did he really kill his wife and her lover in cold-blood?Bottom line is this; I'm 22 years of age a female who hates watching these kind of movies as there really not my cup of tea,I'm sort of a romantic/fantasy/cartoon/drama/weepie kind of chick and I hate watching violent movies,but this movie was really good;but seriously is it the best movie in the world? well for me its not in fact its all about dealing with prison life and the whole motto is get busy or die trying.

      "Never has perseverance played such a strong character on film. The respect and friendship that came from it were against all odds, but to do so one would need hope. Tim Robbins' Andy Dufresne manages that intangible saving grace over decades while falsely imprisoned and it's Morgan Freemans' Red who narrates for us and in constant perspective against the institutionalization of the Maine State penitentiary. The symbiotic relationship between the two is perfect cinema chemistry. The ending is quite fantasy, but makes for good afternoon drama on TNT who, I believe bought the rights for a cheep price, and that's a happy ending for Ted Turner! \n",

      "In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi \n",

      "Let me start out by stating the fact that I am a HUGE Morgan Freeman fan. I absolutely adore most of his work, however, The Shawshank Redemption is the only exception as to just how far my love of Morgan Freeman will go. First of all, in the opening scene, when Morgan is getting rubbed down by two husky white men in the shower, the hot water handle should be facing the LEFT, unless this film was shot in Canada or Utah, I see no reason for this subtle inaccuracy. Second, why did Bruce Willis decide to concentrate his fire strictly on the escapees of the prison?! Why not on the inmates that were tucked safely in their cells?! Finally, the third and final problem that I had with this movie, is this: Hadley is arrested for murder, crying like a little girl as he is taken away, while the Warden decides to shoot his brains out.While the others would talk about Andy's exploits, Red just listens. One day he receives a blank postcard from the Border, knowing that his friend made it there in one piece.Red manages to pass the next parole hearing with an angry honesty that was missing from his past meetings, and is sent to the halfway house used by Brooks. He is lost on the outside and would like to return to Shawshank, but instead he fulfills his promise to Andy, and follows his friend's plan to find the tree he mentioned, and a black box containing a wad of money and a letter.Red breaks the law to violate his parole, and takes the bus down to the border. At the end, on the beaches of Zihuatanejo, we see Andy working on a boat, about to be joined by another free man, Red. Honestly, if you're even considering watching this movie, please spend your time elsewhere. It's terrible. \n",

      "This film is no. 1 on the top 250. I would have to disagree with that. The reason why I don't think it deserves to be 1 or even 25 for that manner is...Tim Robbins acting and this might be coming from a biased point of view because I have never liked Tim Robbins in any one of his films. I have never liked him because of his slow delivery that makes him sound a little bit like Robert De Niro in Awakenings. Also another reason I don't think it deserves to be no. 1 is because of it's plot. This plot is completely unoriginal. I mean wow an African-American man and a white man become friends in pre civil-rights movement America. One of the few things I did enjoy was the whole middle part (i'll try not to give too much away.) The middle part consists of Morgan Freeman getting out of jail and searching for Andy Dufrane (Tim Robbins). Also one of the few things that is fantastic about this film is the supporting acting and the Directing of this film. Overall I would put \"Shawshank\" at about 35 on this list. \n",

The brutality and corruption which goes on in Shawshank Prison...never hits the viewer right between the eyes (like it should). Thats due to the calming tones of our narrator...Morgan Freeman. Mans in-humanity to man....is on full display here...and its this strange mix of violence, upright stoicism and high morality that makes for a heady brew. Lets not under-rate the narration of Morgan Freeman---this was a huge reason why this movie is now considered to be...a Classic. So, why did it bomb when it was released ? Maybe it needs a couple of viewings for all the gears to mesh (Who knows?) My major criticism , is that i thought the two leads needed to be a bit more edgy , a little bit more angry. After all ..they weren't Saints. However, the messages that most people take from this movie are positive (me included).

The acting was indeed superb and the way of expressing the changes in character and settings was impeccable.To reiterate to an audience what was occurring inside of the jail, and to depict changes in emotions and feeling with such clarity definitely justifies that the director of this movie was more than the average one in Hollywood.1994, 18 years ago, was when this movie was made but to the level to which it takes one is truly outstanding. One is absorbed by it, and there is no confusion about what is happening but rather thoughts in the viewers' minds about \"What is gonna happen next?\" These thoughts are present when watching a horror/ thriller movie for the most part, but for aficionados of different genres to all like this movie proves that this was one heck of a movie.Cannot miss this movie; it is one that makes one think, learn, and be entertained simultaneously. \n",

Incredible job by everyone involved,and this is a very rich movie,it goes everywhere and never misses,and the control and confidence with which it is driven forward by Darabont reminded me of Coppola. It also reminded me somewhat of The Hill,Pappilon,Brubaker which are one of my favorite films about incarceration.Which brings me to my only discontent about Shawshank Redemption: the fact that Andy Dufresne succeeds in solving everything so completely. Revenge,freedom,happiness,reward for his patience and determination, all with one precise blow. And fate somehow cooperates.Well,that's too much for me.The happy ending was nice,but it was a bit too happy.It really goes straight for that pure part of our being that would want everything to be spectacular and complete, which gives us great emotions but ultimately \"insults\" our common sense.Andy Dufresne managed to beat the system. It took 18 years but he did it. Beautiful but I don't buy that. Makes for a great movie but doesn't leave much room to meditate.However I wouldn't even think of rating this one less than 9 and really deserves top marks. However,looking around me and thinking about my fate and the fate of others and the fate of the world, I see no Andy Dufresne's. I see the warden, I see Red and I see almost all characters but not Andy.He's like Tristan or Heracles to me,and I don't believe in those hero myths.So,almost perfect movie,but I'll make and take a point by rating it 9. \n",

Great acting by not only Tim and Morgan but by most of the actors. The small \"stories\" besides the main one makes it great, too. The library, Red's tries to get released, the boy who had met the one who committed the crime that Dufresne was sentenced for and such things help the movie going on without making it boring.

The Jail(was in Mansield,Oh./now torn down), the music, the fantastic performances from a slew of great actors, Whitmore as Brooks, Robbins as Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman as Red,..they all did a spectacular job. This is a film(one of the few)...that will leave it's audience in tears of happiness.

      "I just saw this movie for the first time. My daughter watched it first when she was 12 when it first came out. She went on and on about it saying how great it was then in about 1995. She also loved \"Trading Places\". I guess the moral of both of these stories is that the good guys win in the end. I now know what she was talking about. It is a great movie, and I can see why it appeals to women.The movie is set in a prison, with the time old tradition of a close friendship over many years of an innocent young man as the hero and an \"old lag\" who knows all the ropes, in this case Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. This is the same formula earlier used in the films \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" and \"An Innocent Man\", both films which are highly recommended, if you liked this one.The film, although made in 1994, goes back to a time when good wins out over evil. unfortunately the fashion for a long time in the nineties movies was for bad to win out, as in \"the Terminator\" and other movies. The bad guys are as usual the prison boss, The Warder and his Second in Command, the Uniformed Chief Officer. There is a highly unusual twist at the end of the movie, in which the good guys win out. This is a highly improbable situation, but fantasy is allowable in movies. One character of note is that of an old man, played by James Whitmore, who rescues a tiny bird, and nurtures it for years. Thank goodness it doesn't get killed by some other evil person, as usually happens. The old man has to cope with pressures in the outside after he is released.The overarching theme of the movie is one of hope. No matter how bad things get, there is always hope that thing will get better. It also shows that it is possible to have a friendship between black and white people, as the older man, the main character's friend, is a black man. The thing that this movie gave me, is that I can see how wise my daughter already was at 12 years of age, and more importantly, it gives hope and a good philosophy for the rest of my life. I'm sure that it will do the same for those of you who see this movie too.I am unsure as to whether it deserves to be rated the best movie of all time. However movies with hope and goodness as their main themes are generally up there, take \"Gone With the Wind\", \"Schindler's List\" and \"Lord of the Rings\" as examples of this. \n",

Masterfully conceived and directed by Frank Darabont, a powerfully adapted story from Stephen King's short story, amazing acting, and one of the best musical scores ever written made this movie one of the handful of masterpieces that will never die. Along with Goodfellas losing Best Picture, choosing Forest Gump(a great movie) over the Shawshank Redemption was the biggest mistake they ever made. The movie that makes many references to redemption and hope is like Jesus himself. The film did poorly in the box office but has enjoyed one of the greatest afterlives in the history of cinema.Plot: The story is taken from Stephen King's short story \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" and Frank Darabont made one of the only movies better than the source material. Masterfully crafted to start with a depressing image of everything the film goes to make one of the most uplifting, happy, and powerful endings in the history of film.Acting: Narrating is Morgan Freeman who gives an Oscar-Worthy performance as Red a lifer for murder in The Shawshank State Prison. Tim Robbins likewise gives a powerful performance as the sympathetic Andy Dufresne a lifer for murder as well. Playing the cold and ruthless Mr. Norton the Warden is Bob Gunton who creates one of the greatest villains I've ever seen on screen.Quality: This film is one of the greatest ever. One of the things that really made this film was probably one of the best, most uplifting and powerful musical scores I've ever heard which also deserved an Oscar. The camera work was also fantastic opening with a sky-view of the prison.This is one of the few movies where if you don't see the genius of it I will have to question if you really seen the entire film or any of the film. This is along with Goodfellas the greatest movies ever. There are only a handful of masterpieces in history and this is one of them.

In prison, Andy inspires his fellow inmates with his courage and humanity and has a profound effect on Red (Morgan Freeman), an older prisoner, who has given up hope.Unlike many films of the 90's, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has \"high concept\" plot premise and is somewhat episodic compared with the tight, linear narratives of closer structured pictures. This sense of freedom in the storytelling allows the film to consistently throw up genuine surprises, as the viewer isn't constantly on guard for clues and plot points. In hindsight, we tend to forget how successfully director Frank Darabont leads us to expect a very different resolution.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" does things well that you might not expect. It has lengthy voice-overs (that actually work well) and it has a sappy predictable ending, but yet these elements work because they are not placed in the over-used, meaningless context that movies today place them in. The voice overs are also consistently used in such a way that distinct worlds are created. There's a real world inside the prison and the surreal outside world.These two distinct worlds are created help to place the viewer inside the halls of the prison, they are no longer watching a movie, but they are also feeling it.This is a movie that will remain a favorite of the people for many decades to come. 10/10 \n",

I guess that leaves redemption. To me, he paid way too high a price for thinking about, but not actually, killing his wife. After she cheated on him.

When he goes to jail, the first step onto the prison ground will change his life. When he's been beaten around by the queer bull Diamond brothers, he decides to wait a few years to escape. Before these years he decides to meet the institutionalized prisoner Red (Morgan Freeman) who can get Andy or other prisoners whatever they wanted. He can get you packs of cigarettes, jack hammers, naked lady cards, and posters of Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe etc. Andy wanted a jack hammer to crack his wall. Red promised Andy that if the guards find his hammer, they will never do business again. Andy never got caught and Red and him both became friends for a long time. Andy became a big hit for the prisoners and the guards when he helped them with their tax problems. In exchange he got the prisoners beers. After he got the prison library to expand. That is most of what I can say about 'The Shawshank Redemption.'Why did this film not win any academy awards? I felt this film was a lot better than the brutally charged 'Pulp Fiction' than Tom Hanks life achievements as 'Forrest Gump.' This picture sees life more beautifully and more possible. This is a great luminous character study of fortitude and friendship behind bars at its finest. \n",

      "I saw this movie at the end of a particularly bad and miserable day in my life and it is safe to say that I was not particularly looking forward to this one.Two and a half hours later I was on my feet again and was once more prepared to look the world in the eyes. Such is the power of this movie.Tim Robbins plays a sincere man who is sent to to jail for a crime he did not commit. Inside, he meets extraordinary human beings, all of who you will fall in love with within minutes of meeting them. Chief among these is the character of Red, played by none other than the legendary Morgan Freeman.Together with Andy and Red you learn about life and friendship and the evils inherent in human nature. You laugh with them, are sad with them and feel their pain, and in the end, when the two friends meet again on a remote beach years later, you finally break down and cry with them.This movie is emotionally powerful and reminds us once again what the movies should be.It is not sentimental in any way, and that is a rarity these days. And if you do not feel sad, and your heart does not beat faster with Morgan Freeman's soliloquoy at the end, you cannot call yourself human. For, then, you have missed one of the greatests gifts one can receive: a passion for life. \n",

      "Best movie ever made. From the beginning to the end this movie is so perfect it's hard to put it into words, every little detail is stunning. Maybe my opinion is not the most objective because this has been my favorite movie for quite some time, but however, I remembered the first time I saw it. I could't get it of my mind for a couple of days. And still, after seeing it over 20 times, I often think about it and smile. The part when Andy escapes and the next 30 minutes after that you can't stop smiling, it's so perfect. The biggest star must go to Morgan Freeman who gives this movie even more deep and feeling. To everyone who haven't seen it yet, do it, you will not regret it. \n",

      "This for me is the best movie of all time because it shows companionship through out the movie between the two main characters (andy and red). It's true to life with the little details of when it was set and the story was genius, great twist at the end when he reveals the hole in the wall, great stuff, your rooting for Andy the whole time as we all know he is innocent. He gets his revenge in the end by out smarting the person who over looks the prison, which for me is the best part of the movie. The three sister also shine a light on how desperate in mates can get, and Red shows the craft of an experienced prisoner smuggling small goods for the rest, he takes Andy under his wing and tells him moral after moral. Great movie, i can watch it over and over again, which, normally i cant with most long movies, but this is one movie that is something that little extra special. Watch it!!!! \n",

      "I read this novella in Stephen Kings \"Four Seasons\" while i was doing my GCSE exams. i remember then what a profound effect the story had on me. A story of hope through extreme adversity and the power of friendship that i thought could not be found between two men. The sheer anticipation of this film being released was almost heart stopping, but coupled with the fear it would not live up to my expectations. i also remember thinking that i did not want to see it for fear of it shattering my own perceptions of the two main characters, ANDY and RED. i need not have feared a thing.....the screenplay and adaptation was done with nothing short of pure brilliance. the camera work and choice of location could not have been more suitable. perhaps it is a symbol of how well Mr King writes that, it seems, everyones picture of everything is the same!!! Thus is was quite easy to choose sets, locations and of course actors. In the book, RED is a white, Irish man......against all odds, i cannot imagine ANYONE else delivering such a captivating, believable and utterly brilliant performance as Morgan Freeman. This man deserves 20 Oscars his acting together with the small stabs of narration are mind blowing who else could have done this?!! NO-ONE!! Tim Robbins IS ANDY!....his whole movement and attitude were exactly what King had written, this was encompassed in Robbins' portrayal perfectly. together the chemistry they had was beautiful, you could see that these characters were good friends, as well as the actors that played them. The visionary pieces of the film that will always linger? well the whole film lingers, such was the effect it had on me, but the two specific points in the film? Firstly, Andy described to RED where he could find a box, near a tree in a field, under some rocks to be exact. Now this bit is in the book (obviously!!) but i remember when i read it, the picture of that tree, in that field, next to that wall. In the film it was as if they had asked ME to choose the location, a chill went down my spine and it nearly brought me to tears!!! and i am NOT KIDDING!!!!. The second bit, well its right at the end, its the smile on RED's face when he sees ANDY again. This is not a feeble lip turning grin.....NO this is a full , both sets of teeth, cheek aching smile!!!! it IS the biggest and most emotional smile i have ever seen in any film. i could go on for pages about this film, i have been a film fan ever since i can remember, sitting with my father on a Sunday afternoon (before the times of VCR's or satellite, when you watched what was on that day or tough!!!) we watched films like \"The African Queen\", \"Bridge on the River Kwai\", \"Citizen Kane\", \"The Rear Window\", etc and from then i always liked a good film with a good story, The Shawshank Redemption was already a good story, it took genius to make it a GREAT film. to date i have seen it over 100 times. this has taken me through 3 copies on Video before the DVD came out, i am now on my 2nd DVD. if i have to buy another 100 DVD's it will always always alway be my number one favourite film of all time. It is a film you can watch at any time, when you are in any mood and it is still as compelling as the first time i saw it, or indeed the first time i read the story. 20 out of 10........ \n",

      "In the 11 years since the release and realization of the brilliance of this film, I'm sure many, many legions of people have written reviews that summarily praise (and viscously, ignorantly degrade - you know who you are, those whose reviews appear under the \"hated\" tag on the reviews pages) and criticize the movie. I can't add anything that hasn't been said before, except just say how much this movie affected me and how much I love it. Tim Robbins, always a great actor, and always very, very human. Morgan Freeman, c'mon, who da man? Who da MAN?!?!? HE DA MAN!!! He DA MAN!!! He DA smooth-walkin', smoother-talking', illest muthaf***in' epitome of \"cool\". And not a bad actor, either, heh heh (yes, I know I am drastically understating that fact). The direction - flawless. Every shot, every camera angle, every color tone (plus the quality of the film and the cameras themselves) embody such finesse, such power. Humanity! That's what the word I was looking for, the word that describes what every frame overwhelmingly emanates, even during the \"brutal\" scenes (I put \"brutal\" in quotes because I unfortunately have seen plenty of sick s@%* in my life and am now sadly desensitized to movie violence; violence on the news and in real life though, DAMN I get sickened and angered at perpetrators). The very human friendship twixt the leads are very well handled, never turning into cutesy schmaltz or soap-y melodrama. The writing. Yes, I know. \"How the hell does his cell open up into a pipe drain? That's horrible plot!!!!!!\" Ask yourselves: If his cell wall didn't open up over the pipe, would he have escaped? Would the story have been the same AT ALL if his cell opened up anywhere else other than that river of s@%*? And then think about Andy. Would someone of his intelligence would have discontinued his digging and succumbed to madness if what he saw when he looked through the initial tiny hole on the other side was anything other than a road to freedom? Convenient plot twist? Sure! But not outlandish. It could happen (not like a New York Cop winning a $4M lottery ticket and tipping a waitress half, no matter how much he wanted to get with her). Very good storytelling and very tight screen writing. This movie is great. Plain and simple. It did confirm one thing in general to me, though, especially in these times of moral conflict that is dividing the \"greatest nation on the face of the earth\" bitterly: Those who thump the bible the hardest, usually cling to it the hardest out of fear and out of guilt. Love this film. \n",

It was sufficient for Andy that he knew he did not commit the murders. He lived his life for the future, not for the past.There is something very touching about the scene where Andy does some financial work for one of the warders, and all the prisoners get beer as a result. He just sits back and smiles - and his unselfish act has such excellent consequences for him, both with his relations with the other prisoners, the 'sisters' and the guards. \n",

      "This is simply the greatest film ever made. when you see this movie it will take to a place of where it is not just a movie but the greatest story ever told and some amazing directing by Frank Darabont, the acting is also great and it stays strong for the whole movie. This movie deals with personal encounters and problems the characters will face, on top of that it contains unforgettable dialog and some moments you will never forget, you will be truly moved by this movie and will wish it will never end. because this is my favorite movie of all time it was not hard to get in that place because of how great it was, i thought it was even better than the classic \"The Godfather\". this is a movie i will recommend to everyone who like movies movies because trust me you will love this.Morgan Freeman in my opinion is one of the greatest actors and has only won an Oscar for his work in Clint Eastwoods \"Million Dollar Baby\". I thought he should have won and ward here and for \"Driving Miss Daisy\". He has just recently been in the thrilling \"Batman Begins\" which the best out of the \"Batman\" franchise. Tim Robbins is a varied actor, I'm not saying his movies are either good or bad, what I'm saying is he can play any role like in \"Bull Durham\" he plays a cocky baseball player and in \"Mystic River\" he plays a disturbed family man. But when you see Freeman and Robbins together on screen it is something very special and in this situation it creates the greatest film of all time.Frank Darbont, the man behind \"The Green Mile\" and \"The Majestic\" wrote and directed this wonderful film adapted from the Stephen King Novela \"Rita Hayorth and the Shawsank Redemtion\". This is the best adapted King book, only a few others are that good, Stanley Kubricks thrilling adaptation of \"The Shinig\" and Darbonts \"The Green Mile\". frank Darabont does not drag on anything in this movie because not once did I get bored, you may think that there is not much that goes on in this movie but there is always something that is happening. At the beginning you think that Andy(Robbins) will not be able to last the first night, and you see Red(Freeman) and his friends making bets on who will freak out, to their surprise it is the fatty who freaks and Hadley beats him over the head which ends up killing him. After this Andy knows he is going to have to stand up for himself, he quickly becomes friends with Red but enemies with Heywood. Heywood and his friends would beat on Andy because he is the new guy.

A friend brought the video over one night for us to watch it, and MAN! I was blown away. The theme of the movie is hope, and what hope, and the lack thereof, does to people.

I have read some posts where people don't like the ending, but I think the regressing shot of the two friends is right on; you see the culmination of the struggle to be free for both men, yet it's not in your face sappy.As far as the best scene, I would have to say it's a three way toss-up:1: The aria scene 2: Brook's suicide 3: Red in the wheat fieldI probably pull the DVD out once a month or so to watch this gem.

      "Currently, on the IMDb top 250 Movies of All Time list, the top two movies both hold ratings of 9.0. Of these two, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has roughly twenty thousand more votes in its favor. Ergo, I do believe that \"The Shawshank Redemption\" should finally ascend to its rightful place on this web-page, and hopefully cinema history, as the Greatest Film of All Time. That having been said, I wish now to give my own thoughts on this film, thoughts which will be hitherto corrupted by myriad spoilers.The acting is astounding. Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne delivers the perfect combination of hope and despair, so that you can love his character without ever truly knowing what he shall do next. Morgan Freeman brings subtlety and depth to a character who would perhaps otherwise be much simpler. Bob Gunton allows you to genuinely fear Warden Norton, and if James Whitmore's performance does not make you lachrymose, nothing can.The plot is beautiful, describing the redemption of many an inmate. Red, though he does not escape institutionalization, becomes a good man. Tommy Williams does the same. The best of all endings however, is Andy's, as he goes through so much to come out clean in the end, something expressed both allegorically throughout the story and literally at the end.The greatest film I have ever seen. \n",

Now, Clancy is in HBO's \"Carnivale\" series and has his own website! As for the warden and \"sisters,\"  they were equally well-cast and the plot of the movie flowed despite what fan-sites may or may not nit-pick about.It is a tribute to perseverance and determination combined with patience and retribution couched in careful long-term planning that any true financial head is accustomed to (remember, Andy was a Bank Manager, that knowledge saved him more than once)...Justice sometimes comes from beyond the law if you can wait long enough!

      "Overall, this is one of the finest films I've ever seen. Frank Darabont's masterful screenplay rendering of Stephen King's marginal novella brought every possible human emotion into play. And, every actor in the film did a superb job of translating this fiction into a believable reality.On a scale from 1 to 100, I'd rate this movie a solid 99. Only one thing was lacking in the film to raise that score to 100 ... but this is just a personal thing.POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOWS:During his time in prison, Andy Dufresne learns the identity of the man who killed his wife - a man named Elmo Blatch. And, he learns enough information about Blatch to render him \"trackable\" by an investigator. If 2 brief scenes had been added to the film, I'd have rated it a perfect film:ADDED SCENE #1 - Shortly before his escape, Andy is seen talking to another inmate who gives him contact info for a person on the outside who does contract murder.ADDED SCENE #2 - Shortly before Red's release from prison, we see him reading a newspaper story on the murder of an ex-con named Elmo Blatch.Between the time of Andy's escape and Red's release, there would have been ample time for Andy to hire a private eye to track down Blatch and, afterward, hire a contract killer to kill him. Had I been Andy, I'd not have felt truly free of the suffering I'd endured in prison unless I knew the real killer got his just due. What Andy did to the Warden and Hadley is all well and good. But Blatch's death would settle all scores once and for all. \n",

      "I first saw this movie when Channel 4 showed it in the UK in September 2001. I had just come back from a wonderful holiday in Ohio, USA and had never heard of this movie before. I just happened to flick to channel 4 and caught a glimpse of Morgan Freeman watching Tim Robbins make his entrance into Shawshank. I had missed the opening scene with the court case. My first impressions was that this was going to be a typical prison drama but I reached for the TV guide and read more about it. It starred Morgan Freeman who I remember from Along Came a Spider and Deep Impact and Tim Robbins who I have heard of but never seen on screen before. The TV guide gave it a good rating and review so I thought i might continue to watch it.In the opening scenes, I predicted possible rivalries between Andy and Heywood, however I was glad this was not the case as both characters became well-liked throughout the film. I even thought there would be tension between Andy and Red, but I was delighted that they became best friends throughout the movie. Along the way, I found the movie becoming interesting with many plots running alongside each other and beautiful photography. I held my breath when Hadley almost threw Andy off the roof and Morgan Freeman's story telling was first rate. Another scene that moved me was Andy playing the Mozart record and giving hope to all prisoners in Shawshank. I even went out to buy the fantastic soundtrack with the song as well as the superb score by Thomas Newman. I must say I was concerned when Andy got in trouble for that stunt, as I thought eventually the warden was going to help him solve his case. All the characters gave memorable performances and I was moved by Brooks taking his own life as he couldn't cope on the outside. I was shocked when Tommy revealed Andy's innocence and equally curious when the warden refused to help him. Nothing prepared me for the way Andy escaped, I was so glad he did but felt for Red at the same time. I was thrilled when Red got his parole and just hoped he didn't feel institutionalised like Brookes. I thought Red blew it when he talked up to the parole board but had a chuckle when he finally left Shawshank. Other moving scenes were Red reading Andy's letter and making his way through the fields surrounded with grasshoppers. The scene that took my breath away the most, was the shot of the bus as it made its way along the road with the brilliant sunlight, it looked just like the area where I had just come from in Ohio, as well as Red and Brookes in Main Street, Mansfield which I recognised. This film is long, but it certainly didn't seem that way to me, it is a movie you wish would go on for a bit more longer. I was stunned at the end, very moved, very happy and almost in tears. This film is truly a work of art, probably the finest movie ever made with superb acting from all of the characters, beautiful music, cinematography and so much better than the novel it is based on. I cannot believe it did not win any Oscars despite many nominations. It gives the viewer a sense of hope, happiness and satisfaction all in one and anyone can see this movie whatever mood they are in. The movie is also funny, who can forget Hadley with his, \"if I hear anything more than a mousefart...\" or Tommy explaining when he got arrested and had to drop a TV set. This movie makes you feel great to be alive and as Red says this movie is \"so beautiful it cannot be expressed in words\". I bought the DVD for my family to watch and their stunned silence at end confirmed my suspicions that they loved this movie too.Shawshank Redemption is going to be re-released in the UK in September and I would encourage anyone who hasn't seen it before to go and see it and hopefully feel the same way I felt when I first saw this movie. There is so much to appreciate about this movie and everytime I see it again, I love it even more. \n",

I am not in anyway saying that it is a bad film, in fact its a great film. However, I never thought Shawshank would appeal to so many people. It just seems odd that it has received over 112,000 votes (More than the Godfather) and it is #2 on the Imdb top 250 list. I do not think it deserves this high position but it is nice to see the film get alot of notice.Shawshank deserves high marks in these categories: Directing, Acting, Cinematography, and Writing. This was the debut feature for Frank Darabont and he chooses to let Shawshank unravel at a slow pace. This is the perfect choice for the film. It moves slow but it is nevertheless compelling. There is only one time when the slow pace actually interferes with the film.\n",
      "Darabont also gets some highly impressive from his cast. Tim Robbins gives a strong, subdued performance. Morgan Freeman, who was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, does an equally strong job here. The chemistry between them is effective too. As strong as the two leads are, they do not outshine the supporting cast. All of them are excellent but two of them deserve to be singled out. James Whitmore gives a brilliantly moving performance. Bob Gunton also deserves mention as the warden in charge of Shawshank. Cinematographer Roger Deakins should be given a lot of credit. He finds the perfect mood for the film. Shawshank is not a colorful place at all. He creates a dreary atmosphere that fits the film perfectly. There alot of uses of the color, gray that is used to create this atmosphere.\n",
      "I have heard a couple of complaints that the film gets a little preachy at times. I cannot find where it does. In my opinion, Shawshank Redemption is a well-written film. There are numerous memorable quotes.Shawshank does have one flaw. I think it begins to drag near the end. This happens after Morgan Freeman is released from prison. These moments are the only times when the slow pace interferes with the film.\n",

      "(very minor spoilers) I had to add this to my previous comment after reading a more recent review here on IMDb. The review stated that Christian fundamentalists hated the movie because it showed the true hypocrisy of the Warden, along with his oft quoted Bible and the stitched verse on his wall \"Judgment cometh...\" behind which he kept his ill gotten gains. But I am a Christian conservative who loved this movie for that very reason. It shows that God looks at the heart. The Warden had a wicked heart, regardless of what came out of his mouth and what he hung on his wall - and clearly his judgment did come! Andy was kind at heart, offering friendship and help to any who would accept it, and well, he got what he deserved in the end. When Red gave up trying to pretend something before the parole board, trying to tell them what they wanted to hear and instead just spoke the truth, he gets his parole. Both Andy and Red refuse to give in to the despair of prison life - instead doing what they can to bring a bit of beauty to the prison. Andy never loses his humanity, and helps Red find his again. They keep hoping till the very end, but don't just sit around waiting for justice, but actively seek it. The ending makes the movie.My husband will not watch it - having a strong aversion to \"prison flicks\" but I have seen it several times, and reading some of these comments has made me want to see it again.It is one of my all time favorite movies - I never get tired of watching it since I went out and bought the DVD. The first 30-45 minutes are full of heavy language and prison violence, but that only makes the contrast between those who have given up their humanity and those who have held onto it. Not appropriate for young children, but for those able and willing to look at the reality of life - it is beautiful! \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption (1994/Frank Darabont) **** out of ****\"I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up DOES rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone. I guess I just miss my friend.\"- Red (Morgan Freeman)This is the ultimate story of friendship. It tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a young hot-shot banker who is railroaded for a double murder in 1947. He is then sent to Shawshank Prison, where he soon befriends Red (Morgan Freeman), a man 'who can get things'. The movie spans almost 20 years, and shows the growing friendship of these two men. Joining them is the old pro James Whitmore as Brooks, who does a great job as a man who \"lives in fear\". This is the best \"feel good\" movie of all time, and one of the best of the 90's. It is flawless in a departments. It is based on a short story by Stephen King, and is masterfully put onto the big screen. Freeman turns in his best performance, and has many great lines as the stories narrator. In fact, the film is well written and projects deep meanings of triumph and hope. Many critics have complained that the film is too long. Whomever truly believes this can not call themselves a film critic. The film is slowly paced to show the long growing friendship of Andy and Red. It's pacing is what makes it so real and excellent.SPOILERS: The ending is the best part of the film, and has probably the best scene in motion picture history: Andy's Escape. The film's music plays a big part in this scene, showing Andy's determination and endurance. You end up rooting for him all the way. Another great scene is when Andy talks to Red after he gets out of the \"hole\". Red reveals his weaknesses and fears, but Andy has hope.This film is a masterpiece of story telling, and should not be missed. Like I said in the beginning of the review, not only is the film flawless in all departments, it excels in every way. You will believe in hope.-30- \n",

      "Most viewers do not want to go to overly \"artsy\" movies because usually they try too hard to be intellectually stimulating but fail miserably because it is a difficult feat to pull off.  Movies like American Beauty and Amélie are few and far between.  And then there's The Shawshank Redemption: simple, honest, without pretense.  It appeals to the viewers heart and soul and not his/her head.  No one cares if the prison conditions are 100 percent believable.  It's fiction for a reason!  I never even noticed the clichés until I read a detailed post describing them, and frankly, I'm content to ignore them.  The spinner bait that hooked me on this movie was the relationship between Andy and Red.  Watching this movie for the first time (and dozens of times since) I found these two characters to be two of the most likeable characters I could think of.    The climax of this movie is in my top five of all time (TSR, Memento, Usual Suspects, Se7en, The Manchurian Candidate).  In general, people like happy endings.  I am a big fan of tragedies like The Deer Hunter and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but I cannot watch them continually with the same emotion.  Watching Shawshank for the Xth time, I experience the same emotional roller coaster as the first time viewed it. People dislike the fact that so many people give this movie a 10/10 rating.  I feel quite comfortable giving this movie that rating because it is my favorite movie.  It is not a perfect movie, but the rating system doesn't go by technical merit.  People should rate films based on their opinion as a whole and not solely upon how well the director uses cinematic techniques.  Personally, I couldn't care less \n",

      "Contains minor spoilers\"The Shawshank Redemption\" has a lot going for it. The cast and acting are absolutely top-class, the main characters (Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman) are very likeable and the \"bad guys\" (warden + guards) are really evil.In terms of story, I found this movie to be good, but not that special. It has some truly touching and emotional scenes, some good jokes and the twist at the end is surprising and satisfying. Also, you've GOT to admire the persistence and positive attitude of Tim Robbins' character: NOTHING gets him down, no matter what things happen to him, he always keeps believing in himself and fighting back in his own way. But overall, there also were some pretty dull scenes and prison movies cliches in this movie..things like the rapists or the old man with the bird, and the whole new guy/old wise mentor thing have been before. Also, the pace is a bit slow at times.All in all, this movie certainly was entertaining and refreshing, and it left me with a good feeling, but honestly, I didn't find it THAT special. At least not special enough to warrant a #2 position in the top 100. Oh well, it's all a matter of taste I suppose.***1/2 out of **** stars \n",

      "I find it very interesting that this movie has ranked so high in this database.  One professional reviewer elsewhere had referred to it as an \"overrated cult film,\" and I can see why.  It is one of those movies that is so unique that it just grabs hold of some people while doing very poorly with the general public at the box office.   But to be ranked as one of the best movies of all time?  I honestly don't see why.Personally, I thought the Stephen King story it was based on was much better.  True to his style, it was a very surrealistic tale about something that couldn't possibly happen in real life.  SPOILER AHEAD!  Come on, it is sheer fantasy to think that someone can dig himself out of prison with a rock pick over the course of many years without someone catching on to what he is doing.  I think that's why the movie is so popular:  it's a feel-good fantasy that pretends to be a prison drama.But it is very entertaining, and keeps you wondering if Andy really did kill his wife.  The ending is too predictable, though.Overall it is a very well-acted and directed movie.  However, the objectionable language and the homosexual rape scenes were totally unnecessary to the plot.  It would have been MUCH better if those aspects of Stephen King's fertile imagination had been left out of the movie.  If not for those parts, I would heartily recommend anyone to see it. \n",

      "Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul. \n",

      "Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget. \n",

      "This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want. \n",

      "I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in \"The Shawshank Redemption;\" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Citizen Kane.\" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate, Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the \"Birdman Of Shawshank,\" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie, but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10 \n",

Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film.

      "Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come. \n",

Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink.

In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those \"Budget Theaters\" over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said \"That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!\" There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... \"HOPE\".  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just \"comes together\" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a \"must buy\" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, \"That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!\"  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my \"favorite of all time\", but they've all fallen far short of \"The Shawshank Redemption\". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the \"employee picks\" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!! \n",

      "I was a little surprised at first to see this film ranked #1 out of all possible candidates in the IMDB user ratings. When I thought about it, though, it made more sense--this is a \"Rocky\"-type feel-good movie that doesn't really make you think and reinforces what we would all like to believe about human nature. Don't get me wrong--it's a fine film (I gave it a solid 7 out of 10), it's just not, in my view, up there with _Casablanca_ and _The Graduate_.I guess the main problem I have with _Shawshank_ is the nature of the script and characters. Think about it: is there a single person in the film who isn't a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out with very simple motivations, or a Hollywood cliche or stereotype? We have (in no particular order), a corrupt, bigoted prison warden (who is a religious hypocrite for good measure), a brutal prison guard, a man who is wrongly accused of murder, an old convict who knows all the ropes and can't live on the outside, and a convict who is murdered by the brutal guards. Now where have we seen this stuff before? Only in a few dozen movies made from the 20s to the 90s. There's really nothing new here. Probably this comes from the fact that the story is from Stephen King, who doesn't really do well with complex characters (a problem I noted as far back as _Carrie_).If you want to see a good prison picture, try _Cool Hand Luke_ (from which this movie borrows considerably). If you want an escape picture, see either _The Great Escape_ or _Papillon_, both with Steve McQueen. Or if, by some chance, you want a crime and punishment movie that really makes you think, go with the late great Stanley Kubrick's _A Clockwork Orange_.I couldn't stop thinking about the warden: doesn't he have a family? How did they feel? What are they going to do now? I realize the story is inside the prison, but I wish the movie had made better use of its characters than simply as simple-minded symbols of EVIL or VIRTUE.I'm not Mr. Cranky, I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed it the same way I do an Italian dinner at the Olive Garden--a well-constructed genre product with nothing special to commend it. \n",

      "I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes. \n",

      "This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen. Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison.  This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph.  Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity.  It doesn't pretend to be clean, nor could it be called a family movie.  It is brutal and violent at times, horrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all. Redemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life.  What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art.  This is what movies were meant to be. \n",

Masters said everything I needed There is not yet aware of the movie and I watched it for people to watch I would like to invite.Than You.Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising \"twist\" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it.

      "None of the usual otherworld creatures that populate the works of Stephen King are to be found in The Shawshank Redemption. But the real world of that Maine prison has some bizarre rules of its own and there's a whole new reality within those walls.In the tradition of Cool Hand Luke and Birdman Of Alcatraz comes Tim Robbins who was a banker on the outside, but when he caught his wife cheating on him with a golf pro from their country club, he's convicted of putting eight bullets in them, four apiece and tried and sentenced to two consecutive life terms in Shawshank prison. Like Luke and Bob Stroud he works out his own rehabilitation and rebels against the prison system.He may be a con, but Robbins still has all his knowledge of finances and pretty soon he's made himself quite invaluable to the warden and the rest of the staff at the prison. At the same time he and the cell block scrounger Morgan Freeman develop a close personal relationship. In the end they beat the system in a most unique way.There have been some classic prison films made ever since The Big House at the dawn of the talkies. Two I've already mentioned. My favorite prison film is Robert Redford's Brubaker, but The Shawshank Redemption comes pretty close. As does The Green Mile which was also directed by Frank Darabont.Darabont got an Oscar nomination as did the film itself and as did Morgan Freeman for Best Actor. The Shawshank Redemption was in for a flock more Oscar nominations in 1994. A couple other good performances are that of James Whitmore the institutionalized con who is there for 50 years and paroled and just can't make it on the outside. He will break your heart as will Gil Bellows who plays a fresh, but rather likable young con who runs afoul of the warden.Speaking of which Bob Gunton as the warden will positively chill you with his corruption. You would have to go back all the way to the James Cagney classic, The Mayor Of Hell where Dudley Digges was the warden of boys reformatory to find a warden that is as sanctimonious and as corrupt as Gunton. This is a man who gives Bibles out to each inmate hoping that the reading of the Good Book will improve the moral fiber of the convicts. At the same time he's raking in money every which way he can and a rather special punishment is meted out to him by Robbins.The Shawshank Redemption may not have monsters and other worldly creatures that normally characterize a Stephen King story. But the world of Shawshank prison is bizarre enough for any normal person if you see this wonderfully crafted and acted film. \n",

It's been almost a month since I saw a film that was flatout bad; the worst review I've given in weeks was a 6/10 to Flightplan. This film obviously didn't break my streak.I went into it knowing next to nothing, only that IMDb has it ranked as the second best movie of all time, that it was based on a story by Stephen King, and that it took place in a prison. Needless to say, it blew me away. I wont say a thing about the plot, just so that others who've yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me. I will say this though: It has some of the most subtle and unexpected twists you will ever see. One in particular stands out above the rest.Not much can be said about the actors that hasn't been said. Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career, and even though I've only seen 2 or 3 other Tim Robbins movies, I'm sure the same can be said for him.Though I don't agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made, it was still a very good, very well made, very entertaining and almost heartbreaking film.9/10 \n",

The portrayal of friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls.

      "At first, before starting the movie, I thought \"Sounds like a typical prison riot and break-out kind of movie\". At the beginning of the movie, my thoughts was even more convincing. A large prison (Which immediately reminded me of the movie \"The Last Castle\" from 2001), housing people of all sorts, having it's guards, warden and of course, the inmates. The typical inmate; Roughneck, hard on the outside, broken on the inside. And they all claim their innocence, as an internal joke sort of speak.It gets to a point where I started comparing it with others. That proved wrong in quite a short while, from the point where a prisoner, framed for murder of his wife and her lover, is being convicted and sentenced to life in prison. His name was Andy Dufresne. In short terms, a straight-up bank employee, excellent with numbers and taxes, which he also uses to benefit within the walls of the prison. His reputation as a numerological genius spreads out, and soon all kinds of people, inmates and guards, are coming to him for financial advice. He builds up a library, he maintains a strict surface. He has his hobbies, to keep his mind busy (as said in the movie). He carves chess pieces out of stone, using an axe as the tool. Seemingly, this is a nice and lucrative hobby, but underneath it all, he has a secret...The movie keeps the viewer thrilled and excited, because in every minute, something could happen. The dialog is good, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both great actors, shows and outstanding play. The crew really did good work on the set, the right camera angles, the light, sounds and so on...it was almost like I could smell the prison!A brilliant movie. Not too short, not too long. It's worth every minute watching! My highest recommendation for those who like drama, action and humor. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a story of life itself. It is not about a person in prison, it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and carries on to deserve the life it has been given by God. I watched the movie for the first time some months ago. That evening I was about to go out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and I had to stay home. Being unhappy about that, I started watching the movie on the TV just by chance, not knowing about its existence before that at all. At first I was skeptic, I admit that. But oh God, at the end of it I was screaming and jumping in my room at 1 AM! It gave me so much emotions and so much hope, I had never felt before that. I could hardly believe that a movie could make me feel that way - so excited, so happy about my life, leaving me believing so much in my own self. It is a great story of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do. In The Shawshank Redemption desire does not make you weak, just the opposite - gives you wings to fly away from fear, fly closer and closer to freedom. Morgan Freeman's voice is just another advantage that makes the movie even more impressive. Tim Robbins' act is just beyond perfection! I bought the DVD this summer and every time I feel weak or just bad about something, I watch the movie. It has become my personal shrink, making me feel strong enough anytime I watch it. Can never imagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after 1000 years! \n",

      "When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies of all time, I thought \"Yea, I could understand that\". I don't necessarily agree that it's absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top.It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity. It's funny, because I don't really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I'd pay to hear it, his narration breathes life into every scene that it's spoken over. The real beauty of this film is it's story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it's the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery. Stephen King's novella \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he doesn't use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you can't help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different. If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It's one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive.An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10. \n",

      "When I first saw the Shawshank Redemption, I was in a movie theater on a week night at around 11pm. I had gotten out of work from working the evening shift. I was tired and just wanted a little amusement. This was at a time after Shawshank had been released but got little attention. I had heard some Oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me. I half reluctantly chose to watch it. That night, I was not prepared to be blown away. I didn't see a movie, I was transported by a story. I was instantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin with. I wasn't just entertained, I was emotionally moved and intellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner. If this film remains on IMDb's number one spot for a long time to come, It's well deserves it. To me personally, the Shawshank Redemption is a testament as to why the 90's were an interesting decade but more than that, why a film can become an experience and gain instant classic status. There are two simple rules you should follow prior to watching T S R: one, if you haven't seen it, don't let any one who HAS seen it tell you anything about its plot, Don't listen to a word caus they might ruin it for you. Two, make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the film; no phone calls, no door bells, no other plans. Watch it from beginning to end. You can't over hype this film it's just that good. What i've written here is just a small fraction of what I can further express by way of praise for the film. Long live The Shawshank Redemption on IMDb ! \n",

      "I have grown up watching Bollywood movies, full of overacting by overpaid, overfed 'heroes'. It was in college that i got to see some fine Hollywood films and this one was probably the finest of the lot. This film at first appears to be a story about life in prison. It fully describes every small experience of a person serving a long prison sentence. Life is not easy there for a lot of reasons. The screenplay is ably supported by Morgan Freeman's brilliant narration offering a second-person view of life in shawshank. But Tim Robbins steals the show by aptly underplaying the part of a wrongly sentenced, wealthy banker.The last forty minutes of this film, however, help raise it a couple of levels above other cinematic masterpieces. You don't need a weapon to fight. It is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope. \n",

      "Despair or determination; crying or fighting; obedience or inner freedom; resignation or patience; fear or hope...difficult choices in life make us all more powerful human beings. Experience makes us richer; hardship makes us stronger, friendship makes us better. Although we may be deprived of everything, only our own choices may truly deprive us of human dignity... These words ring the bell for the majority of people; yet, seldom do they appear so unique, so real and so concrete as in this wonderful film...Based on the novella by Stephen King RITA HAYWORTH AND SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, the story appears to be unlike any other movie, unlike any other adaptation of Stephen King's stories onto screen, unlike most productions of the world cinema. Why? I think that every viewer has to answer this question oneself. What I am going to do in this review is not look at why it is so powerful, why it is so unique but rather focus on a certain aspect that, in a way, refers to this question. What absorbed me to the very core of my emotions and feelings is the main plot of Andy (Tim Robbins), the banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to Shawshank prison where brutality and wretchedness really reign. At the spot where for many people, life actually ends, for Andy a new tedious struggle begins. Quickly befriended by \"Red\" (Morgan Freeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances, within the \"hell on earth\" they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom...Here, let me refer to Roger Ebert's words who nicely described the character of Andy: he says that \"Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him.\" Indeed, salvation lies within discipline for him...self-discipline...Except for some other plots, including the touching yet tragic story of Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) and of the sympathetic librarian Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), it is Andy and Red who supply us with the most unforgettable moments in the movie. It is, as a matter of fact, the story of their friendship, their dreams expressed at the wall of despair. They maintain hope around themselves and within the viewers. Here, a very powerful aspect of Red is his narration...our thoughts are directed towards his thoughts, towards his reflections and his perception of the events, his - the prisoner's. Swear words take on power to convey meanings and harshness becomes reality. Here, it is important to mention the inevitable brutality in the film. Thanks to the fact it is perceived by Red, it never appears to be unendurable or harmful for the emotions of the viewer. We, as observers, truly know what world we are led to...yet, there is no loss of hope!The unforgettable scenes seem to evoke the most powerful associations and expectations that lie within us concerning the visual and sensual experience. With Thomas Newman's terrific music score consisting of dark piano music, we are supplied with intense emotions and effective thrill. Except for the symbolic and almost cult scene when Andy escapes the prison (mind you the almost claustrophobic effect), one cannot skip \"The Letter Duet\" scene when the excerpt of Mozart's \"The Marriage of Figaro\" is being played. The prison life stops for a while being awestruck by the glimpse of harmony, by the blissful moment of magnificence. At this moment, I was breathless and really second the powerful line: \"Music makes you free!\" The performances are awesome and the depiction of characters is executed in an extraordinary way. There are no clichés which is a great merit of the film and where many films of the genre fall into that trap. Although there were many actors who had been cast for the role of Red, I think that no one would have done the job as well as Morgan Freeman. He is perfect in the role combining a certain quality of patience and distance with the emotional struggle for personal rights. Ironically, he portrays a re-socialized character...in fact, richer inside than any \"corrupted decency.\" Tim Robbins also does a terrific job as Andy with all his features mentioned before. And Bob Gunton as a true villain, the boss of this hell of Shawshank will long remain in memory.To sum it up, I agree with short but meaningful words said by Roger Ebert: \"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a movie about time, patience and harmony...\" I would even add that it is the film about true life where people are really themselves, to the most extent themselves. There, within the harshest reality... Because only there, we truly behave according to our rules. There, we make choices even if everything that surrounds us seems to yell: \"Salvation lies within blind discipline and fundamental Bible!\" A redemptive masterpiece, a masterful redemption...desperate Brooks was here...and so was Red...yet, he brought a new dawn for dreams, a new dawn for friendship... Will he succeed? \n",

But then I ask myself: Do there really have to be a purpose? Maybe not.The first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption were a couple of years ago. I had looked up the evening's TV program and I stumbled across the movie title. Not really expecting anything out from the film's summary, I sat down on this evening and watched it. And did it move me. I was completely blown away by everything which the film contained: The acting, the environment, the music - and the story. The ladder plays an important role in the movie. Why? Because in short, the film is about a man who is wrongfully charged for murder, and the next many years in which he spends inside prison. But there is something more to it. The story is so well polished, constructed and so well told, that you wonder about what was done in the process of creating the movie, which could have made it so moving and so heart-touching. Because really, it is all the details and the finesse of the movie, which takes the film to a higher level than any other film which are told through storytelling.Throughout the 130 minutes of the film, you will be witness to fantastic all around acting, particularly from Morgan Freeman who does a hell of a job working as the story teller. With the film starting out slowly, it smoothly starts to work towards the second half of the film, where the film really starts to touch your soul. The ending of the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best on film ever made, I dare say that.I could continue endlessly naming the goods of the film, but there is simply too much. In the end it is hard to point out what makes the Shawshank Redemption so much better than everything else which you have ever seen.

      "If you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film, then it is excellent (10/10) because it truly gets you involved in its main character. It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience with a heartfelt and well-acted buddy-story at its core. It delicately--and sometimes brutally--juxtaposes Andy Dufresne's (Tim Robbins) good-natured character with the harshness of prison life, projecting so much heart in doing so.However delightful as it is, The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance. It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches - it's only a very safe buddy-story. A damn good one, but still just that. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied, because what will it be remembered for? Friendship? Huh, neat. I therefore don't think it's entirely deserving of being considered the #2 greatest film of all time on IMDb.com.But moving on and looking past that, it is possibly one of my all-time favourite films for the feelings it leaves. Sure, it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely, but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story. On top of that, it never falls prey to predictable sappiness - probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship. It is so well-sewn together by a feel-good narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film.9/10 \n",

      "This film is a modern classic. Why? Because it simply includes everything which builds a great story, and that is all films really are, storytelling.The concept of story telling can very easily be lost and forgotten in an industry that can sell cinema tickets by using special effects and employing world super stars like Tom Cruise. That may well be the easy option, but films that rely on pretty faces and big budgets will never be remembered. It is films like Shawshank that will lodge themselves into people hearts, and will be passed down by many generations.This is because everyone that watches this film becomes a part of it. You are there, in that prison, suffering when Andy does, smiling when Andy does. Tim Robbins plays this part so well it could be classed in one of the best lead parts in a film ever. He is simply superb. Plus, Morgan Freeman, well, would we expect anything less from a man with such talent?It is this relationship, between Andy(Robbins) and Red(Freeman) which really strikes me as a breathe of fresh air, as if i had been hit in the face by a strong wind. We are trapped in a society where relationships only seem meaningful and deep when the two people involved are having sex. Hollywood have molded this preconception that characters with a relationship must sleep together. Shawshank, for once, tells the tale of two men, who by the end of the film have a very strong relationship, but have not gone down the Brokeback mountain road of madness. Their friendship is portrayed free of sex, yet is portrayed so powerfully that you are emotionally taken back by the ending. Personally i nearly cried at a friendship so pure yet so meaningful.The plot is also perfectly timed. I am someone that is usually quite critical if the speed of a film moves too fast or if it drags on. Shawshank gives you a mixture of paces, but also keeps the story turning and turning, as if it has a heart beat, pumping more and more of the story line, unwinding the plot before your open jaw.Another subject i would like to comment on is the swearing. Again, i am normally quite critical of films that have swearing in, just to look cool, or higher the rating. Swearing in that context seems unnatural, and therefore disjointed. However the swearing in Shawshank seemed totally natural, and all part of the atmosphere of the prison.Finally, i think everyone should see this film. This is a pure, yet thrilling tale of hope, friendship and belief. The story is executed brilliantly, with intense characteriztion from both sides of the spectrum- you become Andy, and go through his struggles with him, and you hate the warden and his captain with a passion.I guarantee, by the time those credits gracefully slide up the screen, you jaw will be open, your mind will be blown, and your heart will be broken into pieces. This is a truly unforgettable masterpiece. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over, catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it. Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning it's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent this, or better yet, buy it to get the full thrust of it. Definitely on my personal top 10. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good .. or in, this case, brilliant.Although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the 1950's, I can easily imagine it being transferred to today's time and standards. The thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers, of course] didn't use extreme clichés - there's no black and white painting, just numerous shades of grey. Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their roles, as are all of the supporting actors.Finally, I can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking. \n",

The most complete movie that i've ever seen. Tim Robbins is great, sensitive, brilliant: in one scene, he can feel a thousand of feelings. Freeman is very correct and seems to be really \"Red\". Gunton, Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 oscars. This movie deserves 30 oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No action, more realistic, more useful than the other films. It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it. When i see it again, I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinema's industry have. In a different way, only Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact. \n",

His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend Red.As Red's long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel.  Andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom, and he follows it.This film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light.

      "As an omnivorous reader movies are always second to books to me. I believe....movie can never defeat the book because while reading book we use our own imagination....and movie narrows down the imagination.....it only allows us to see how the director has imagined the book.But Believe me...this is not the case of The Shawshank Redemption...which I rate as the best movie I have ever seen.For the first time in history the book(the Stephen King Novella) has been defeated by its movie version.After watching the movie I was crazy about reading the book....I thought wow!the movie is so good...how will be the book!!To tell U frankly,the book is good, but the movie is best.There are some unforgettable scenes in the movie which were not in the book.Some examples are: The scene when Andy locks up the guard and play the opera on the microphone.The narration goes on like..\"I didn't understand a single word that Italian lady was singing...but I tell U..for that single second every soul in the Shawshank prison felt free...\"The scene just fill my heart with Andy's yearn for freedom...I was kinda shocked when I didn't find it in the original book version.I can remember another scene.While Andy creates the prison library and starts listing books sent to prison from charity organizations...a fellow inmate tries to read a name on the book...Alexandre Dumas as \"Dumb-Ass\". Andy says....\"its not Dumb-ass...its Dumas..and U may like the book..The Count of Monty Cristo...its about a jailbreak.And the category it falls is Fiction\" Then Red says..\"Why don't we put it on Educational category?\"(Right before Andy listed an engineering handbook as \"Educational\" category).As Count of Monticristo is one of my favorite books, I was hysteric watching this sophisticated joke.This was also not in the book.This DVD is my favorite gift I give my friends. And after they watch it....they always thank me . Like many other IMDb friends commenting on this movie..I would also like to say..\"Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen in my life\".Thanx to all. \n",

      "I simply fail to understand how this film is so popular... it's quite simply beyond me. The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of King's short story found it very true to the spirit of the book, and voted 10 for that. I really could not find anything worth my time in this film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there's really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for. It's about hope... and the director won't let us forget it, so it's repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep. It's like this short, one-note story was written, and the author just didn't want to end it... so he kept writing... and writing... until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling \"for the love of all that is holy, stop writing!\" And I thank that faceless man for doing that, because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes long, and not 284, or, dare I say it, 568. The film simply drones on and on, scene after scene, containing nothing remotely interesting(but with excellent acting, mind you). There's nothing good about this film except for the acting. Just about all of it is great. I can't really think of anything else to say... I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of King's writing. I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film. I recommend this to fans of Stephen King, the actors and possibly Frank Darabont. If you're not a fan of any of these people, I doubt you'd find this enjoyable. 5/10 \n",

Sometimes I get frustrated and feel as I should runaway to some place where I could feel free. I hope and dream for it sometime. This movie just reminds me of my feelings so much. I love Andy Dufresne most in this movie. Although critics say Tim Robbins didn't do enough to express the character but my personal opinion is that he was made for this role.I can go on and say more but I said the most important thing which I feel whenever I watch it.I am glad to visit IMDb. I never heard of it before. Some 7 years ago I saw it at no.2 in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately. Only other movie which even comes close to this is Citizen Kane.

In a Perfect World, SHAWSHANK is the movie of choice. What a serendipitous confluence of diverse and inspired elements! It is the exception that proves the Murphy's Law rule. Just look at the IMDb breakdown analysis of the vote",

In our culture there is a recurring undercurrent nightmare scenario of long-term wrongful imprisonment. Make that a Universal scenario, perhaps, in ALL cultures. Not a SPOILER here, because this point is clearly established in the opening 5 minutes. SHAWSHANK is the ultimate Black/White \"BRO-mance\"",

But the interaction of their characters is clearly that of 2 equals, gradually morphing into one of lifelong best BUDS! I can't help but wonder if, while cast and crew were in the midst of making SHAWSHANK, any of them imagined the magnitude of the cinematic milestone they were involved in! Box Office results are rather jaw- dropping, but in a negative sense: Opening WeekendA starkly paltry Position #144 among 1994 releases of just $750K U.S.! Overall 1994 Box Office, did not even make the Top 50! SHAWSHANK occupied a lackluster Spot #51, to be exact, with just over $28 Million taken in!

My wife became an instant SHAWSHANK believer. We both categorize this film in our lifetime top 5 favorites! Perhaps SHAWSHANK got off to such an inauspicious Box Office start for the same reasons that almost resulted in my wife not going to see it in 1994! I could literally write volumes on this movie, but, of course cannot here! A few more highlights: Interestingly, 7 Oscar Nominations, but ZER0 wins! Had the amazingly bad luck of having to compete with the mighty feel-good classic, FORREST GUMP, which steamrolled that year with 6 Oscars and #1 at the Box Office with $330 Million, about 12X SHAWSHANK's!

      "Along with Q and Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont (The Walking Dead original writer) and his debut film got screwed by the Hollywood Powerhouse that is Tom Hanks with this now can be considered an American Classic. The fact that this film barely and I emphasize barely made it's money back in US theaters (which is usually a signal for a film to turn into a DOA when released at home) and it made such a splash, that the film is exceeding what anyone thought a simple 18 years ago. This includes some of Hollywood's best critics including EW's Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B- back in late '94. Yet over time, this story of redemption, like the rise of hope this film gives from beginning to end, grows on you to the point where at the very end, you have no choice but to clap (I clapped in my basement in front of my parents and I haven't looked the same since). Darabont found a formula that worked and it shows in his future films. He made Robbins human, made Morgan Freeman's voice as American as a Big Mac and made the late great Rita Hayworth relevant again. The only regret that one should have is the fact that if it was released two years later it would've swept away the Oscars (Sorry Ralph Fiennes, The English Patient won on a weak year.) \n",

It's like nothing I ever see in my lifetime can ever compare to the emotional roller coaster that 'The Shawshank Redemption' takes you on.First question I usually ask people when discussing films is, \"So have you seen Shawshank?\". No matter what their reply is I am happy with the outcome because if they say no, then they are yet to see the greatest movie of all time. If they say yes, I have something to talk to them about for the next 27 minutes.You probably still won't believe me when I tell you that this is the greatest film you will ever see.

      "THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely one of Stephen King's more restrained kind of stories, dealing mostly with a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the consequences that await them when the tale ends.TIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long prison term while MORGAN FREEMAN (who plays the narrator with great dignity) describes himself as \"the only guilty man in Shawshank.\" The hardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the viewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape. Along the way, he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a brutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish. But Robbins is quietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he takes charge of the prison library and sees to it that there's a wider selection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for writing. A touch of irony here, no? The closing scenes are a bit of a stretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison tale--but still, they make an impact because of all that happens before.It's a bittersweet story, a sort of horrific fairy-tale of what might have happened, but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of the tremendously skillful story-telling magic of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay. \n",

I love the opening scene where the camera pans around the prison, and then the music kicks in, it makes you feel awe-inspired.  The acting was brilliant, you believed what everyone said (some films the words are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness, that it makes you want to throw up). I have watched Spiderman, and even the lines in that make you feel that they mean nothing, they just sound good. \n",

If I have a rubbish day at work, then it's true that music just lifts you, which is re-emphasised with the scene where he plays the music full blast around the prison (this of example of piece of script, which means, so much). The movie uses music to it's full potential to give more impact to the words and the characters.  This film cannot replicated, because the film is a piece of art, the Director wanted to make money, but he also wanted to make a piece of film that made you feel something, that had some effect on you after the movie was over. The movie has no bad points it's what a story should be about, it takes you somewhere that you nether been, and makes you feel you lived that experience, and you can learn from that experience.  The lines delivered, will always be remembered 'Get busy living, or get busy dying' (this is the dilemma we face in everyday live).

      "In this review I'm not going to give a plot synopsis of this film because I'm sure everybody else who has commented on it has. However, I will express the positive effect it can have on the viewer if they let it.The acting is uncommonly magnificent. Morgan Freeman delivers the greatest performance of his brilliant career as the seasoned life-serving prisoner Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, Tim Robbins holds his own against Freeman as Andy, the central character, James Whitmore's portrayal of the institutionalized Brooks provides the backbone of the story, Bob Gunton is wonderful as the corrupt Warden Norton, and Clancy Brown's commanding performance as Captain Hadley, the sadistic head prison guard, almost makes him steal the show from Freeman.Frank Darabont's restrained direction of the delicate story is critical for the film to not become sentimental or clichéd, and his beautiful adaptation of the Stephen King story on which the movie is based is a real breath of fresh air. On account of Darabont, the film shows that special effects are not needed to tell a great story in film. As a 17-year-old male, I love special effects movies as much as the next person, but they get boring after a while. Plus many people forget that there was a time in cinema when the blockbuster didn't exist, when they made movies that just told great stories and gave the audience a chance to be uplifted by those stories without the creators having to resort to special effects. I applaud you for having the guts to make a non-commercial film that reminds people of that in this day and age, Mr. Darabont.SPOILER ALERT! As with all truly great films, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is full of scenes that have become entrenched in the public's collective consciousness. There's the scene where Andy plays the opera record over the loudspeaker for all the inmates in the prison, Captain Hadley bashing \"Fat @$$\" to death for crying during his first night in prison (a very powerful scene), Red giving his \"Rehabilitated?\" speech to the board of parole officials, the Warden getting his final judgement, and of course, Andy crawling to freedom through what Red in his narration calls \"500 yards of s**t-smelling foulness I can't even imagine,\", the scene which for me is perhaps the greatest movie scene of the '90s.END OF SPOILERS! I thoroughly recommend this cinematic masterpiece, which has earned its place in my humble top ten films of all time list, to anybody. Whatever gender, age, religion, nationality etc. you are and whatever language you speak, I guarantee it will change your life, or perhaps even save it.

Andy being a banker convicted of murder and Red a murderer already serving time, this movie takes you to the limits of human endurance, where the human spirit eventually prevails. The TSR takes you on an emotional journey that you will remember for a long time, thanks to the superb crafting of the film and sincere performances by the cast. The score is deep and haunting, this film is for the ages and will permenantly have a place in my heart. To me it is the best film of the 90's and quite possibly one of the best of all time.The fact that this film is sitting at No.2 is a testament to just how many people love this film, many viewers seem to have an emotional bond with the film, and I don't blame them.

I thought it had probably wrongfully earned the #1 spot here on IMDb, and couldn't be better than The Godfather for example. A movie that was \"cool\" to like, if you will. I could imagine fashion conscious movie-hipsters discussing movies over their glasses of Napa Valley Chardonnay, arguing who liked Shawshank Redemption the most, and which movie by Ingmar Bergman had the strongest metaphorical messages. You get the idea.I'm sure everything I have to say about the way the movie has been made has been said better in one of the other comments. That said, the reason I'm posting this review is because Shawshank Redemption isn't only a hardcore movie freak's wet dream. While it's brilliantly written, has some of the most fluent acting I have seen and shows the fantastic directing skills of Frank Darabont, you really don't have to be an expert of film theory to appreciate it. It appeals to so many different groups of people, and so many different human feelings at the same time. The \"weaknesses\" it had as it came out (the idea of a jail movie not being compatible with the female population, and the idea of a movie about lifelong friendship between two men not being compatible with the male population) is actually the reason Shawshank Redemption is loved by nearly all: It offers something for everyone.In my opinion rating something 10/10 is a bit too absolute for anything, but since this is probably the best movie I remember seeing, and my first 10/10, I think I'll let it slide this time. \n",

It reminded me, naturally I would say, to Papillon, the 70's McQueen/Hoffman classic.I like the story, the acting, basically everything, and I definitely recommend it to everybody. But compared to Papillon? There are so many similarities that one has to think that idea of the movie did not came out of the blue. Because of that the movie has to accept to be compared with Papillon. And Papillon is simply even better. It is emotionally much more touching, and when even Freeman's great performance doesn't match Hoffman's, there is no doubt that Robbins is not close to McQueen - in that role I mean! Tim gave a great performance but his role didn't give him the chance that Steve had.Anyway, a joy to watch. But please watch the \"original\" too, it's not old-fashioned at all! I can only guess, but I think the huge differential of 9.1 for SR and 7.9 for Papillon is because most young people have never seen Papillon. \n",

Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King's short story \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" (in the film version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole. However, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three-dimensional characterizations. The finale is pure fantasy, however it does provide the audience with the release it needs, and Robbins and Freeman are excellent.

      "The story is described by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the dividers of Shawshank Prison for quite a while and is its driving business visionary. He can get you whatever you require: cigarettes, confection, even a little shake pick like a beginner geologist may utilize. One day he and his kindred detainees watch the most recent busload of detainees empty, and they make wagers on who will cry amid their first night in jail, and who won't. Red wagers on a tall, slender person named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who resembles an innocent bystander. In any case, Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he bet. Andy ends up being an amazement to everybody in Shawshank, in light of the fact that inside him is such an intense supply of assurance and quality that nothing appears to break him. Andy was a financier all things considered, and he's in for murder. He's clearly blameless, and there are a wide range of points of interest including his case, yet before long they go up against a sort of illusion; every one of that numbers inside jail is its own general public - who is solid, who is not - and the deliberate section of time. Red is likewise a lifer. Now and again, measuring the decades, he goes up before the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and inquire as to whether he supposes he has been restored. Goodness, most without a doubt, yes, he answers; however the fire leaves his confirmations as the years walk past, and there is the feeling that he has been standardized - that, similar to another old lifer who murders himself in the wake of being paroled, he can no longer truly imagine life all things considered. \n",

      "What can I possibly add to a review corpus of over 1.2 million ratings and three thousand reviews? This movie has been called \"one of the best movies of all time\", \"a powerful story about friendship, hope and freedom\" and a \"latter-day retelling of the Gospel story\". Many people have seen this movie multiple times, and some claim it has changed their lives and even saved their lives.At this point, I'm rather more interested in the phenomenon than the movie. My take on it: this movie appeals enormously to ordinary people (especially American men) who feel trapped by difficult situations in their lives. Some may be looking to be rescued, like Red was; others may take comfort in the thought that their long-term pain, tedium and oppression will someday result in a spectacular liberating event. This movie satisfyingly scratches that annoying itch called \"life is unfair\".It's difficult to know what to think about all this. Whatever you think about the phenomenon, \"Shawshank Redemption\" is also just a good movie with excellent writing, black and white characters, a simple but satisfying plot with a few surprising scenes, great acting, and a certain amount of tear jerking. It's not a movie to be missed. \n",

      "\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a timeless story of heartbreak, deception and ultimate growth under the most deplorable conditions. The acting is superior, some of Tim Robbins' and Morgan Freeman's best work as they allow me an intimate look inside the sometimes contradictory nature of a convict's existence, where I am torn emotionally between danger and safety, light and shadow, sanity and sorrow, truth and lies, injustice and justice. In fact, I am lost in all the actors' poignant and memorable portrayals of young thugs, cruel guards, swindlers, thieves, rapists and murders, all standing in their respective spaces quietly listening together to an operatic aria over a loudspeaker on the prison yard.In this movie, I find almost no one to be all good or all bad. There are exceptions, though. Although there are those in charge of the prison I wish to be caught in a snare of their own making or worse, there are still others behind prison walls that turn out to be heroes I cheer on to win in the end. Like people in real life, most of the characters in \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" both prisoners and guards (those that are not miserably rotten to the bone), represent many shades of gray.One of the most touching moments in \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a scene in which an elderly convict, who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up, is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories. And his fear of this new and unnatural terrain, crawling with shadier creatures than those he had known behind bars and the exhaust fumes of a thousand horseless carriages rushing past, engulfed him with no hope of ever escaping.\"Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free,\" from \"The Shawshank Redemption.\"As bonds form between people of different ethnic groups, economic backgrounds and intellectual levels, I rejoice in their discovery of the human dignity they share. As the story unfolds, my heart hurts so hard, I cry. Then, with tears still in my eyes, I laugh, the same way my family used to laugh together at dinner or a movie when I was a little girl.Getting older. Times changing. People leaving. Dying. But at the core of the main character's spirit there shines upon all those who are within its range, including me, a contagious hope eternal. I am still astonished with the euphoria that fills my being each time I view this incredible story about the invincible human spirit. \n",

But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and it's popularity grew. Eventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As the years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history.I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion. The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.

In 2006, it was ranked as the greatest film ever by Empire, a film magazine. The year it came out it was nominated for 7 academy awards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all remember, Forrest Gump. It's the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving.

Tim Robbins is \"Andy,\" a smart banker and accounting whiz who was sentenced to 2 life terms for killing his wife and her lover (which he--like most other inmates, say they're not guilty of). And Bob Gunton is \"Warden Norton\" who, when we first meet him, is touting the virtues of Bible reading and strict discipline. While, fortunately, I've had no first hand experience, \"Shawshank\" certainly gives the feel of authenticity of prison life and its society.A long movie, most of it takes place inside a semi-corrupt state penitentiary in the late 1940s. \"Red,\" in talking his thoughts out loud to himself, becomes our narrator for many developments. As the story unfolds, increasingly we come to see Andy as a person with strong personal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations. And in Andy's work for Warden Norton, we also increasingly find the warden as morally his opposite: selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral character--all show and appearance and with no integrity, substance.In Roger Ebert's first review (of his two) of this movie, he said: \"....the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything....the word redemption is in the title for a reason....\" Most viewers will agree. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly the best best movie ever. The Oscar's biggest mistake was giving Forrest Gump the awards that Shawshank deserved. Not to take credit from Forrest Gump which is also an amazing movie, but it just can't compare to Shawshank. Morgan Freeman arguably delivers his best performance and Tim Robbins gives a performance that I feel is greatly underrated, and also deserved an Oscar nomination. The films art direction adds to the story's beauty, and gives off a feeling that fills you with hope. I remember seeing The Shawshank Redemption on sale for $5 at Wal-Mart and thinking \"I heard this is good\" so I bought it. Little did I know the film was worth more than gold. I bought the film and put off watching it for a couple weeks, not overly anticipating watching it, but finally decided to watch it when I was bored. I am a gigantic movie buff, and have so many movies it's almost pathetic, but The Shawshank Redemption changed my entire view of film. Now, every time I watch a movie I can't help but think \"It can't beat Shawshank.\" Some people say that this movie is overrated, but that's wrong. Shawshank is an actual work of art, to be compared with works of DaVinci and Picasso. When people say this movie makes them cry, they don't mean to say it's so sad, but that they didn't know that something of such beauty could be conveyed on screen. I believe that if everybody see's only one movie during their life, it should be this one. See it now. After that, IMDb will seem like a whole new website because every film will seem like a different movie. It is, by the very definition of the word magnificent. \n",

      "If there was such a thing as a perfect movie, this is it. Of course, for practical reasons, one cannot award a film ten stars out of ten, because of the endless stream of new work demanding scrutiny. I'd like also to start by quoting another well known film, which sums up my opinion nicely. 'In many ways, the work of a critic is easy- we risk very little, and thrive on negative criticism, which is amusing to write and to read. But the harsh truth of the matter is that the average piece of junk is probably more valuable than our criticism designating it so'. This could not be closer to the truth. When it comes down to the wire, critics risk everything in dishing out praise, for fear of being ridiculed themselves.There can be no such danger with The Shawshank Redemption. It is an eternal masterpiece, timeless and inspiring. I avoid being clichéd, when it is at all possible to do so, but The Shawshank Redemption is beautiful, masterfully acted, with just that right amount of tenderness. This is a tale of moral courage, and the everlasting fight for justice. As with other films of the genre, one can tell what will happen, of course, but when you watch this film, you will time and again be genuinely surprised, and maybe even shed a tear for the persistence and unquenchable thirst of the human spirit. One leaps for joy after watching this incredible film, at the knowledge that evil, in all senses of the word, can, and will never triumph.Turning an eye to the technical side of things, just for a moment, I can discern not one single badly executed shot. The Shawshank Redemption is well written, and, as I have said before, brilliantly acted. Characters that could be flat are all allowed to develop and flourish, and the film is even better for it. The film grabs our attention, right from the word go, with agitated shots of Andy looking like he IS going to kill his wife. And the soundtrack. Well, there isn't much to say; except that most of the music in this film is some of the most beautiful I have ever heard.This is a deeply satisfying, wonderful, brilliant, fantastic, soulful cinematic work. Watch it, if you haven't seen it, and if you have, you must agree that this excellent film will be an eternal classic. There are, of course, films that people will prefer, I myself am strongly attracted to Subway, a 1985 film by Luc Besson, but for pure facial and objective value, cinema does not get much better than this. \n",

The movie depicts how a four lettered word 'Hope' brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possible.Though the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane, a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison, the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of Andy Dufrane (just amazing) and how he influences his fellow prisoner 'Red'. The narration by Morgan Freeman in the role of 'Red' is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across. This story proves that the king of horrors, Stephen King, is equally good at any other genre of 'Story Writing'(Hats off). The dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring.

The thing that makes this movie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly believable (and bad guys don't come much worse than them).The other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: It must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning, middle and end.

Tim Robbins is AMAZING as Andy, and he supported brilliantly by a cast that one could only hope to see assembled again. This is one of those rare occasions where the movie actually surpasses the book for drama, suspense and flow. If you haven't seen this film, please do yourself the favour and watch it. I know you will not be disappointed!\"Get busy livin'\" \n",

From Braveheart to American History X to Pulp Fiction to Schindler's List to The Matrix, I thoroughly enjoy watching and talking about great movies. After being desensitized by the poor gore-fest known as Hostel, I came home and watched this movie with some friends. Let me tell you that this is one of two movies I can think of that has made me tear up. I don't do it often, and I certainly wasn't expecting to tonight. But the Shawshank Redemption tantalizes your mind and touches your soul. It is a triumph of motion picture and tonight became of of my top five favorite movies of all time.

      "Shawshank is one of the only movies I have ever scored as 10 out of 10. I had read the Stephen King short long before I saw the movie, and loved it, but had no idea going into the movie that it was the same story. Halfway thru the movie I finally put two and two together and almost jumped out of my seat at the theater to say \"OMG, I love this story!\" Fortunately I managed to resist and hide the fact that I'm totally freaking insane for at least one more day...But I digress. The movie stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufraine, a man convicted of murdering his wife. He is sentenced to life at Shawshank prison. Although convicted of the same type of brutal crime as his fellow inmates, it quickly becomes apparent that Andy is an oddity at Shawshank. Highly educated, quiet and philosophical, Andy is initially a source of curiosity and unease to his fellow inmates but is soon befriended by Ellis 'Red' Redding, played by Morgan Freeman, and quickly becomes one of their own.Without giving too much away, the movie follows Andy's life in prison, as narrated by Freeman, as he finds a way to both survive and hold on to a shred of his humanity in a place that seeks to rob him of both. Andy learns, for example, to bargain with what he has (i.e. his financial knowledge) for what he needs. Initially, many of the things Andy acquires during the course of the film seem to have little value, but you realize by the end of the film that what he has asked for has had value beyond measure, both in the pragmatic sense and in a deeper philosophical sense.The movie is at its core an exploration of what it is to be human. It is about loss, regret, perseverance, friendship, and ultimately, faith. How do we deal with the mistakes that we have made in life? How do we recover when life beats us down? And how can we seek strength in our connections to others? These are all ideas that Shawshank looks at. It is alternately funny, tragic, violent, and inspirational. Probably one of the best stories King ever wrote and without question one of the best films ever made. \n",

      "simply the best movie ever made. this movie embraces the philosophy that justice will be done, karma is heard and that goodness will rule above anything in this world. Andy and reds friendship is a strong unique bond, founded under the harshest of circumstances. In prison they each serve their time for situations they got themselves into, but certainly didn't form them as men - or messed with their true character. Andy has no choice but to try and accept his fate, that he will be in Shawshank forever - and on the surface he rises to the occasion by doing the paperwork for the sadistic warden, who treats Andy like the lowest of the low. In the meantime Reds parole is continuously declined, and they both have to re-adjust, even though their life in prison sometimes offers them glimpses of hope and of freedom. Will the time really come, and if yes...are they ready for it? \n",

Better than ALMOST EVERYTHING?!?!No, it's a very, very long, very, very predictable, very, very cliched, very. very old-fashioned and sentimental film, blessed by some good performers (especially James Whitmore, who, alas, does not figure prominently enough.)It worries me that many of the comments  here seem to think the film artistically transcends the usual Hollywood fare, when in actual fact, it wallows in all the conventions of its genre.I give it 6/10, mainly because I like Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.The only people who could mistake this for a Great Film, would be those who mistake the works of Stephen King for Great Literature. \n",

      "I have seen The Shawshank Redemption twice now, the second time being about a week ago. After the first time I saw it, I gave it a perfect 10 rating on IMDb, something I do very rarely (I've given out 20 ratings of 10 out of the 600+ movies I've rated). However, after just one viewing, I felt so impacted by this film that it immediately rocketed near the top of my favorite movie list. After a second viewing, I feel even more amazed by it than I was the first time I saw it. The movie captures your interest in the first scene and unfolds new plot points and character developments slowly at first and then more rapidly as the movie goes on. The movie runs about 130 minutes long, but it never gets boring. While it is admittedly slow paced, this only serves into its greatness. It allows the viewer to get to know the characters of Andy and Red and sympathize with them; along the way, we also get to know and grow attached to the other prisoners trapped inside Shawshank. The movie flows perfectly from one scene to the next, never feeling forced or losing your interest. The movie is mostly dialogue driven, but there are some violent scenes which help convey the brutality of prison life.Finally, the final 30 minutes are perhaps the most satisfying in any movie. I do not want to spoil the ending for those who have never seen it, but suffice to say, the final act of the movie leaves you floored. Both times that I saw it, I was rooted to my seat long after the credits rolled, just thinking about the brilliance of the ending and the entire movie as a whole. Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are both great movies, highly entertaining. I particularly love Pulp Fiction; however, it is a travesty that The Shawshank Redemption did not win Best Picture. It was certainly the best film of the year in my opinion, arguably the best film of the decade, and perhaps one of the finest movies ever made. The even bigger tragedy, though, is that while Morgan Freeman earned an Oscar nomination for his great performance, Tim Robbins' turn as Andy Dufresne went without a nomination. Robbins carries the film, and his performance is truly one of the greatest I have ever seen. The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect movie. It takes you in from the opening scene and doesn't let you go until long after it comes to a tremendous close. Along the way, it will make you think, fear, wonder, and feel a number of other emotions. If you have not seen this movie, waste no time; go rent it today and see why this is the highest ranked film on IMDb. \n",

      "After watching the shawshank redemption it left me with a true feeling of hope. The whole film symbolises the idea that hope can get through any challenge. I heard of this movie in the same way many other people did, through a recommendation from a friend describing it as the best movie he had ever seen. Even though I watched it with high expectations I was not at all disappointed. If I could recommend anything from this comment it would be to watch this movie. Its #2 in the top 250 for a reason! The story the film revolves around and the relationship between Red and Andy is truly amazing to watch but also is the way that each time I watch the film I uncover new depth to it and new angles from which to view the movie. There are many hidden references and ideas that can be taken from the Shawshank redemption making it a movie that works on many levels (this being a rarity for most modern blockbusters). \n",

      "The redeeming feature of this film is that it was made in innocence. Darabont had no idea he was making anything profound.  And he wasn't.  This is a film about a prisoner who ... well, I can't give away the plot, for it's much better to come to the screen in ignorance; but anyone who thinks that this is a story about how Andy `finds out the truth about himself', or is in any way `redeemed', is grasping at straws.  These elements play so little role in the overall structure that we might as well ignore them.I have a theory: so many people have told Darabont that `The Shawshank Redemption' was a profound life-changing experience that he believed them, and then SET OUT to make another `profound, life changing experience' with `The Green Mile', with predictably ghastly results.  I haven't seen `The Green Mile' yet, so I can't be sure.Don't get me wrong.  A great movie needn't be profound, and the film which I think is the best ever made isn't profound, either - it contains no comment at all on the Nature of Human Existence or anything of that kind.  Still, `The Shawshank Redemption' isn't even great.  It's a very good story very well told.  Lucky we get such nice photography, rather than having to put up with Stephen King's prose every step of the way ...  Also, Tim Robbins has the lead role.  (Lucky, again, that it wasn't Tom Hanks - now THERE'S a frightening thought.)  Nobody can do the bewildered but intelligent innocent so well as he can.  Fans make such extravagant claims about this movie, but I don't think it makes such extravagant claims about itself, which is why it works so well. \n",

      "By far Shawshank was the best film of 1994. But look who it was up against at the Oscars...Forrest Gump. It's not that Forrest Gump was such a horrible movie as alot of people make it out to be, in fact it was good. But it was also a very hyped movie. The public ate it up, and they also got too much of it. That might be the reason everybody on the internet seems to hate it so. But to say Forrest Gump is better than the Shawshank Redemtion is a far cry. I wish the Oscar's didn't do this all the time. They vote on who they think the public wants to win it seems like sometimes. It was robbed. But that doesn't make it any less of a film. It's a triumph of filmmaking. Robbins and Freeman are excellent. The character Brooks is terrific, and the warden is protrayed perfectly by Bob Gunton. Go rent this movie, if it's the last thing you do.

Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison. The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I have heard. Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith. The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest film. It has everything you could possibly want in a movie. If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you are beyond redemption. It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. It's in my top five movies of all time.

I am talking about the league of The Godfather, Casablanca, The Good The Bad & The Ugly and 12 Angry Men. So I always called each of them one of the best. I never believed THE BEST ever existed. It can't be, right? How can anything be the best or perfect. Definitely not perfect film. There's got to be something wrong somewhere I just need to look close enough.But I was wrong. Although I knew I was all the way. Right from the very first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption on HBO in 1997 (18 years ago) and I waited 18 years, 5 thorough viewings, 1 sceptical review before I wrote my final judgment of this film. This is the best film ever made. Spotless. True classic. And it was not even directed or acted by the legends we know today. Sure they are true legends. But what Frank Dorabont, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman & their amazing crew did is something extra special. They created the best work on cinema ever with almost none of those legends working on them. This film needs no further description. Ten out of ten in every department of film making. Full of incredible moments. Beauty, class and intellect in almost every scene. You do not need to know the No.1 film status on IMDb for over a decade to actually believe in the power of this genius work of art. This is the best, if there is one. This is the film that reaffirmed my faith in hope, human perseverance and friendship. I'm sure there are many who believe this isn't that great, but I am glad I think otherwise - and believe me, its a great feeling.

One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it.

I can happily say that \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has stuck to me since I finished watching it for the first time, and instantly rocketed up my Top 10 Films list. Most great films have one or two obvious flaws that can be easily picked out - not so in \"Shawshank\", at least not to me. The hefty run time doesn't put me off because the story and characters are just so well rounded and so easy to return to time and time again. \"Shawshank\" is one of those films that I would love to experience for the first time all over again. The thrill of emotions and the highs and lows I felt that first time are incomparable to much else. In my opinion, \"Forrest Gump\" was not as deserving of the Best Picture Oscar as this.

There is no better movie that I can recommend you to see than this classic Jail Break that stared one of the best supporting actors you will love to have on your side if you are in the lead role of a movie, Morgan Freeman.Shawshank Redemption was adapted from a Stephen King novella named Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Frank Darabont secured the right to make the film from King in 1987, and he worked intensively on the screenplay for a proper adaptation of the movie, Darabont's screenplay writing earned him an Academy Award nomination, in fact the movie had seven Academy Award nominations and won none.The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker who got convicted for murdering his wife and her lover; he got two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. At Shawshank Andy befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman) Red was a contraband smuggler.Andy also developed a nice rapport with the warden and the other guards helping them with their taxes and also helping the warden in his money laundering operation.The movie boast of amazing scenery not to add an impressive cinematography, the movie growth and inclusion and exit of characters will make you feel like you are reading a book, the movie has numerous cast, and it is broken into segments each introducing new casts and each building a parallel wall that guides us to the climatic end.It didn't do well in the box office at all barely making back its production cost, but due to critic's high rating and Academy Award nomination, Golden Globe award nomination and other notable nominations, the movie did well in rental and DVD sales, it is shown regularly on Cable TV, and it has a high following.Frank Darabont who is the director and screenplay writer also made more of King's books; He directed the 1999 Tom Hanks movie The Green Mile which was a box office success compared to this. The Green Mile is another of King's books that is about a prison, and Darabont also directed the 2007 movie The Mist which is also based on a Stephen King book.Here is a DVD every home should have.www.lagsreviews.com \n",

The twists, the musical score, the final scene. Amazing.I recall doing some searches (in those pre-Google days, probably with Alta Vista) to find out if anyone else had ever heard of this film. I found out that they had. It turns out a whole lot of people discovered this film as a \"sleeper,\" on DVD or cable or satellite.My favorite movies of around that time, seen in theaters, had been \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Heat.\" I didn't see \"Forrest Gump\" until around 2000 or so, and didn't care for it much. A good year for films.Given the comments in the past half year or so (that I've gone back through), I suppose \"Shawshank\" will fall below some other films. There seems to be a a trend toward making \"Hey, it's not all that!\" (That is, it's not all that good, it's lousy, it's overrated, etc.)Whatever, it's a great film. And when I happened to see it late one night on my satellite system, I thought I was the first to realize how great it was. It took several years for me to spot the high ratings on IMDb and to read that it had become a cult classic favorite.(Ditto for \"The Big Lebowski,\" which for a while I thought I was the only fan of. Now it's a subject of festivals and midnight watchings, sort of like \"Rocky Horror\" once was. I saw \"Rocky Horror\" in 1976 at the World Science Fiction Convention in Kansas City and thought it was not very entertaining.)For me, the last 20-30 minutes is just the best.

      "I will never forget the first time I watched \"The Shawshank Redemption\", with my father. Both of us were fans of prison and male-bonding movies, and choose the film only expecting to watch a solid drama. Needless to say that, when the last line was delivered and the TV screen painted the walls with a beautiful blue, the feeling that we had just watched something exceptional instantly cut through our hearts, and before the second viewing, we would regularly mention how great that film \"with the poster\" was.Then I would never miss it whenever I found it on TV, and after each viewing, it unveiled one unsuspected element of its unique appeal. I guess if it doesn't justify, at least it explains why this movie that didn't do well in the theaters, had a better success on VHS, TV and DVD before it would ultimately dethrone \"The Godfather\" from the first place on IMDb Top 250. And it's only justice if \"The Shawshank Redemption\", the least spectacular of the four Best Picture nominees in the glorious 1994, made by a relatively unknown director, a movie with an appeasing and appealing patience, took its time to grow on people and did it pretty well, as if it applied its own philosophy, patiently but determinedly. This is the strength of \"The Shawshank Redemption\", its ability to tell a story that spans a long period of time without trying to get to the so-called essential, the simplest things take their full meanings, the smallest details have their share of importance. And think about it, in a prison where everyone wears the same outfits, where the days are regulated by the same routine, all you can do is to make a life out of this routine, make a place, to get closer to your own definition of 'having a life'. And as we penetrate the impressive walls of Shawshank, from the first vertiginous panoramic shot, we're literally submerged by the solemn austerity of the location, conveying a very hostile feel. These characteristics are perfectly incarnated by the figure of the Warden Samuel Norton, who's like the male alter-ego of Nurse Ratched from \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\". And the comparison with Forman's film isn't fortuitous as Shawshank intends to domesticate its occupants to the same limits of mechanical alienation, to the point that the only thing left to the inmates is to control their only valuable treasure: time, by getting busy, finding their own reason-to-be, like the veteran Brooks (James Whitmore) was the man with the books, Red, remarkably played by Morgan Freeman, was the man who could get you things.In a very intelligent move from the script, the hero of the film, the laconic Andy Dufresne, an upper-class banker, played in all nuance by Tim Robbins, is condemned to a life sentence at Shawshank, for the murder of his wife and her lover. And nothing indicates if he is innocent or guilty and I wondered if any certitude would have conditioned my appreciation of the character. I think it was necessary for us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let his character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves that he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances, the same feeling that grew in the heart of Red before becoming his best friend. Morgan Freeman is the pillar of the film while Tim Robbins is its free spirit, both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of abstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and 'busy' in the same time. And again, their friendship is a slow process that takes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when Andy was allowed to put his banker's casket again and feels that prison didn't deprive him from his 'social quality'. Shawshank is not slow but more a patience-demanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts our intelligence. And the film's motto, on which relies its philosophical core is \"Get busy living or get busy dying\". Now, two things occur to me while writing these lines, a heart-breaking sequence about the inmate Brooks who was freed after 50 years of detention, and who realized he was institutionalized. A notion explained by Red: when the infamous wall that scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while outside, it's all dark and your time is deconstructed. Brooks couldn't live outside Shawshank so there was no other way he could live. The second thing is the sad passing of Steve Jobs today. And as I was reading his famous Stanford speech, I couldn't help but make a connection with the beautiful message of Darabont's film, an invitation to dream, to escape from any sort of walls or obstacles put in your life and heart with as many dreams as you can fulfill, a notion illustrated by the beautiful scene when Andy put some classical music on the microphone, so the prisoners could for once elevate themselves and having an ephemeral moment of pure freedom, this is the triumph of human spirit, this understanding of the value of life is \"The Shawshank Redemption\"In the same vein than \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\", \"Shawshank\" is a constant encouragement to fight the system and use time for the best, for whatever constitutes our dreams, being men again, able to enjoy, to feel, to give a meaning to our lives. In other words, hope, hope that things can get better despite the adversity. To quote Steve Jobs : \"Courage is the discovery that you may not win, and trying when you know you can lose.\" This is the true intelligence of life, what makes it worth living.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" a powerful adaptation of Stephen King's novel is one of the greatest American films: a powerful story of courage, perseverance, hope and ultimately, friendship and humanity. \n",

      "This film is, love it or hate it, flawless. I find myself unable to pick out any one element of this movie that was poorly executed or inconsistent. The Director, Frank Darabont, despite his much-less-than-impressive filmography successfully animates every scene and character in living detail. Whats more is the life and detail he brought to his screenplay.Originally published under Richard Bachman, Stephen King's once-pseudonym, \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" is one of the most miserable short stories ever hacked out by any desperately uninspired fiction author in history. The book makes no attempt to build or define characters, background, or story progression. It basically apexes around the one scene in the prison theatre where the writer clumsily tries to convey the point of the book: as hopeless as a man's situation is, his dreams and fantasies live on. After King's catharsis he seemingly looses any real interest in his story and apathetically caps it off several pages later.Frank Darabont not only masterfully directed this film but deserves much more credit for crafting 95% of this movie purely from his own imagination and being able to construct a very tangible plot line from complete tripe. Credit where credit's due, Stephen King doesn't even deserve royalties. \n",

The story itself is based on a short work by Stephen King, but the screenplay is sculpted perfectly and gently into a full-length film by Frank Darabont.

      "Where to begin on how to comment on one of the most beautiful, haunting, tragic yet slightly comical films in creation? This film is absolutely groundbreaking and deserves its place amongst all the greats of Cinema History. Complete with an amazing cast, a wonderful soundtrack and a storyline that will leave you mesmerised for years after your first viewing, this film is truly incredible.The film focuses on a man called Andy Dufresne, an intelligent banker who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, and is consequentially sentenced to two life sentences in Shawshank Prison. Andy soon befriends a man named Red, a man imprisoned for murder, and runs an underground syndicate to help his friends get a hold of things from outside prison.Andy manages to help the guards of Shawshank Prison with their personal financial problems using his knowledge as a Banker, and an unlikely 'friendship' emerges, and soon Prison life doesn't seem so bleak for Andy. As Andy's journey through his life sentence grows, so does his friendship with Red, and he soon discovers what effects the walls of Shawshank have on the people in the prison after a series of unexpected and tragic events.Andy's personality soon earns him new friends as he begins to change people, fundamentally, without knowing how, as he spreads new lessons, both comically and psychologically, and soon Andy turns into a much more intelligent man than we may have realised him to be at first.As time goes on, Andy resolves to make Shawshank Prison friendlier and he works relentlessly to improve life for the prisoners and for the guards. But, as he continues to work hard for the good of others, he begins to learn the shocking truths of what the true colours of the guards and the Warden of Shawshank are. Revelations all come to the fore when Andy discovers some information which may prove him to be the innocent guy he has always claimed to be, and Andy's life takes a serious turn, and the consequences are dire for everybody as Andy's decisions become more and more unpredictable.Based on a short book by Stephen King, this film has hardly any faults at all, and is full of beauty, tragedy and comedy, and has a haunting presence as Morgan Freeman gives what is possibly the best performance he has ever given, and Tim Robbins excels as the tormented Andy. But, what makes this film go down in history isn't just the amazing script and the wonderful acting, but the film contains one of the most beautiful Soundtracks I have ever known, written by Thomas Newman. Many of the tunes are simplistic, yet very memorable, and they all perfectly reflect the dilemmas and situations the characters of the film find themselves in.This film is not afraid to shock people with its subtle shifts in the personalities of characters, and how a situation of comedy and hope may suddenly change to a tragedy beyond what you may have originally expected. This film is a true classic. This is a work of art which is endlessly re-experiencable with painful pleasure. \n",

What made it better was seeing how it was expanded so well from the original short story, which again was very good. How anyone can say it less, must not have been watching it properly. There is nothing to say to criticise the movie, the acting was brilliant, the casting great, and the directing, breath taking. But we can not overlook the great writer who brought this story to life, Steven King. Without having writers like him, we would never have any movies to match up to the likes of Shawshank and Godfather.

Stephen King wrote a story which becomes one of the great classic movies of all time. \"Shawshank\" is a story of a wronged man who overcomes the injustices of life, love and prison to remain the true person he always was. Andy, although a solitary and enigmatic person, finds himself through an injustice which throws him into a quagmire of human refuse. In this refuse he finds a few pieces of humanity which lets him know there is hope. Red is one of those humans. Upon realizing that he is about to fall into the hell of prison obscurity, Andy releases himself and escapes from the injustice of his current \"human\" existence.

Afterall Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are quite well-known actors. Frank Darabont however only just caught my attention in 1999, when 'the Green Mile' was released. Finally I came to the conclusion that it must have been either television, because it surely isn't on television often enough, or it could just be me, not knowing very much about the film-world before 1995. For in fact, everyone in my school seemed to have known 'the Shawshank Redemption' for a very long time. \"One of the best movies ever\", my best friend said, \"My favorite movie in the whole wide world\", another one of my friends.

Jim Sheridan's \"In the Name of the Father\" springs immediately to mind. That film has a similar theme to this one (wrongful imprisonment and the struggle to come to terms with it) but is a much better film IMO. What's even more heartening is that it's also true.Like I said, I'm not dissing the film. it IS great. From what I can remember all the performances are nicely judged (Freeman is excellent, but then what's new?), the direction is perfect because it's so unobtrusive to the story, and the film in general is uplifting. I just think it's nothing particularly new and it has been done better. Maybe my viewpoint is borne out by the fact that it only became a huge success on video release?I gave it an 8. To me, this fact proves that I love the film, just not as much as everybody else seems to!I think this adaptation is on a par with the short story, which was also excellent. I honestly can't agree with #2 on the top 250 list though. Is it just an American over-reaction to the movie or is every other nation as awestruck by it? Please feel free to e-mail me for discussion on this, or anything else for that matter.#2 of 250? I don't think it would make it into my top 50 films.Ah well, life's all about opinions... \n",

I did this 6 years ago, with expectations low and a boredom threshold to match I sat and waited to be disappointed. 2 hours later I walked out of the cinema a different person, before I had not been moved by a film, I didn't care if : Indiana Jones made it, Sonny Corleone got wacked, Fred married Ginger, ET got home. Before, films were either plot driven or character driven, they were action or comedy, sad or happy, a few came along that combined a number of facets that I enjoyed, respected  or challenged how I viewed an issue or a person.Shawshank was different, there were characters I believed, not just one or two but virtually all. Throughout the first hour I was gripped the full range of emotions were explored, the second hour building on the characters was even more powerful, some characters came and went but ultimately this was a story of 2 people: Red and Andy. I have never seen a film that so eloquently and beautifully illustrates friendship and hope.This has become the benchmark by which I judge all movies. I am pleased that I am not alone in feeling this way.

      "It was the film that never seemed to have a break cut out for it. Adapted from a Steven King short story (usually a sure sign of success), yet a disappointment at the box office. Nominated for seven Oscars, yet emerging with no wins. But, hope sprung eternal, and, as life began to imitate art, like its central characters, the film The Shawshank Redemption overcame such initial adversity to become one of the most revered and cherished films of all time. Director/screenwriter Frank Darabont, working from Steven King's short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' brings the tale to life in a superbly powerful and emotionally flooring fashion. Darabont's script executes the incredibly difficult task of speaking directly to the human spirit, with its tale of passion and dedication overcoming captivity and adversity. Few modern films are bold enough to tackle such shamelessly inspirational themes as Shawshank's without coming across as painfully clichéd, but Darabont's airtight script, chock full of timeless lines, and steady, careful directing are enough to raise the film above such concerns, instead marking a film of which the emotional magnitude is seldom paralleled. From Roger Deakins' sweeping, operatic cinematography, to Thomas Newman's truly beautiful and inspiring musical score, to the dank, gritty realism of Shawshank prison itself, the film's consistent quality on all fronts is truly stunning. It is easy to see a story such as this easily falling flat with an inferior cast taking on the material, but Darabont's incredibly gifted and memorable cast is truly up to the challenge, taking a wonderful story and making it truly timeless. Tim Robbins truly brings unconventional convict Andy Dufresne to life, never without a passionate twinkle in his eye, even in his most beaten down and hopeless of scenes. Rather than typical leading man grandstanding, Robbins is wise enough to remain subtle and detached throughout, making the role all the more mysterious and endearing as a result. The inspired casting of Morgan Freeman as fellow inmate 'Red' resulted not only in a series of sumptuous voiceovers by one of the most melodious voices in Hollywood, but also in a genuinely heartwarming supporting character, with Freeman building a career of playing similar 'wise mentor figures' off his performance. The supporting cast being comprised mainly of relative unknowns strengthens the believability of their characters, leading the audience to see them as their character and not as the star behind the role. Bob Gunton is chillingly effective as the hate-inspiring prison warden, infusing more menace into his reedy voice and deadpan stare than any scenery chewing antagonist could capture. Character actor Clancy Brown also crafts another simple but effective antagonistic role as the captain of the guards. Gil Bellows is a strong presence as a rebellious inmate, and James Whitmore is charming and lovable as aged prison librarian Brooks. Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is an astonishing accomplishment, addressing shamelessly uplifting themes in a fashion which is sentimental, but never sappy, larger than life, but never melodramatic. In many ways the film feels like a throwback to the days of classic cinema where directors strove to make films which made their audiences happy, but Darabont easily dodges contemporary scorn by unabashedly and honestly pitching the film towards the human spirit, and firmly establishing it as a timeless classic with its impeccable package of flooring technical work, screen writing and acting. Far from being a simple \"prison drama\", the sheer emotional voyage of The Shawshank Redemption is enough to drain any viewer, both crushing their spirits then euphorically raising them in a truly peerless fashion. While Red may declare hope to be a dangerous thing, it's Darabont's fearless tackling of the tricky subject which really sets Shawshank free. -10/10 \n",

      "Out of the fertile mind of American author Steven King, comes the incredible prison story called \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" It is the story of a young banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Sent to the notorious Shawshank, Dufresne, is subjected to the standard abuses every prisoner faces. During the ensuing years however, he is further subjected to additional punishment by the \"Sisters\" who enjoy torturing what they call 'fresh fish.' Still Andy tries to survive each day of his sentence as best he can. Being extremely agile at his banking craft, he overhears Captain Byron T. Hadley (Clancy Brown) complain of his personal financial problems. This single incident allows Andy to take advantage of his dire situation and become useful once again. Over the years, he becomes friends with fellow convict Ellis \"Red\" Redding who is adroitly played by veteran actor, Morgan Freeman. When warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) learns of Dufresnes' financial ability, he immediately takes advantage of it. This arrangement presents many financial opportunities for the brutal warden and the meticulous and patience prisoner. Both can benefit from the outcome. The warden intends to retire richer and Hope is the only benefit Andy ascribes to. Be he has he has more talent than the warden suspects. With additional characters actors like William Sadler as Heywood, Gil Bellows as Tommy, Mark Rolston as Bogs and legendary James Whitmore who lends a superior performance as Brooks Hatlen, this film is destined as a classic for the enjoyment of every audience. **** \n",

I watched it today (Oct 2005) as it was on TV, and I thought, it's got good rating, so I'll watch it, least this way I won't be watching it alone. Might as well get it over with.Well, any movie than can render a grown adult to tears and whirl up an emotional minefield, has to be respected. This movie has my utmost respect.This is truly a great film, even with all my negative baggage, and seeing clips, and reading people raving about it, I still avoided it.To render a grown man to cry even with all the baggage, has to be a really amazing film.This film transcends cinema, to what it's truly about - to move you. So technically, it's pointless, you can go about actors, direction, shots, music and so on, and to analyse this film purely on that level would be one very stupid mistake. A mistake many have used while writing reviews.The book or film, is simply a mechanism to get a message across, it can be flawed and still work perfectly. That's not the point.The message here is clear and works perfectly, on many unconscious levels, it really would be stupid to try an figure it out.You can't as its so simple.We all have hope dreams and desires, and want freedom and a better future. Every person does. It's actually why we exist.Not to have hope, dreams and desires and goals, is truly not to live. Not doing so, there is no meaning to life.No matter what happens, keep positive, have hopes dreams and desires, that is your purpose here on this planet this is what this film is about, everything else is just mechanics to get this across?Are you Positive?Do you have hopes?Do you have dreams?Do you have goals?Have you helped your fellow man, just for the beauty and pleasure of making someone happy, in a totally unselfish way, without any personal gain?If you haven't and don't have hopes, dreams, desires and goals, you are not alive, you have no meaning to your life.In conclusion, you can avoid this film as long as you want like I did, but when it does catch up with you... you better be ready, very ready.If you aren't or don't understand what you are watching, and what really is going on between the lines and mechanics of the imperfect mechanism of cinema you are dead, truly dead, and you might as well end it now.So my advise to you?Don't Watch this film. If you've read this far, and not got what I've been going on about you are a lost cause already, and you might as well go into your miserable life, and causing misery to yourself and others. Heck, it'll take you several lifetimes probably to get it.So, remember DON'T WATCH THIS FILM, you don't deserve it. \n",

Tim Robbins (The Player, I.Q.) stars as Andy Dufresne a smart man convicted of killing his wife and her lover.  He arrives at Shawshank prison completely out of place, but adapts and becomes best friends with one of the prison's head convicts, wonderfully played by Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, Seven).  Soon the warden, played by Bob Gunton (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Broken Arrow), enlists his help as a banker, to help with getting some extra (illegal) money and other things.  It doesn't sound like a great movie, but trust me this is the best movie I've ever seen, and everyone I know liked it.  Tim Robbins is great in the lead.  Bob Gunton is good as the twisted warden.  William Sadler (Solo, Die Hard 2) is solid as a fellow convict.  Clancy Brown (Starship Troopers, Highlander) is excellent as the sadistic head of the guards.  Finally, James Whitmore (The Relic) and Gil Bellows (Snow White: A tale of terror) give the best supporting performances as fellow convicts.  A must see. \n",

But Shawshank is, above all of them, at the top of the list.I love this film. Every time any part of it appears on TNT I stay to watch until the end. I just got the DVD on New Years Eve and watched the whole thing through until 12:34 am. It was the most enjoyable thing I could have watched that night.Every part of the story is engrossing from the very first scene. The film has a way about itself that is uniquely its own. From the way it is shot to the musical score (a masterpiece by Thomas Newman).Any film enthusiast, writer, storyteller, actor, or human being must watch this film. It is masterfully executed from one scene to the next, pristinely edited, and in so many words...perfect. I myself am a filmmaker and have hard time watching even great films without judging what I consider mistakes scene-by-scene. Shawshank pulls me out of that awareness and into a wonderful story and I have watched again and again. It never stops being great. As a writer or storyteller I have the utmost respect for Mr. Daramont as well as Mr. King. The dialog throughout the film is understated and magnificent. There are more than half a dozen classic, memorable scenes that I consider iconic from this film. And to top it off, the performances from all the actors, specifically Mr. Freeman and Mr. Robbins, are timeless.If you have not seen The Shawshank Redemption please make a point to make sure you do at some point soon. It is one of the best films ever made. \n",

      "It is the most basic of all principles of film-making: A story of redemption. This time the story is set inside Shawshank Prison, where successful banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to during the 40s, after being falsely accused of murdering his wife and her lover. The jail veteran, Red (Morgan Freeman), sees Andy being forced through the front gates of the jail on his first day of arrival and sees him as a weakling. Red even makes a bet with the fellow inmates that he won't last. He's wrong.Andy does last, and becomes an inspiration to all of those behind bars. The warden of the jail, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton), is intent on bringing down Andy and his defiant nature, as all villains always are.That is the prevailing message, I suppose. The redemption comes two-fold -- Andy is given time to reflect upon his life in Shawshank, and Red (who is obviously deeply moved by Andy's influence) learns a thing or two, going through a cleansing process. We see the gradual change, too -- first Red is the cynical veteran, then the curious insider, then the close friend, then the surprised object of redemption. As strange a title it may be, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a worthy one.At the end of the day, \"Shawshank\" is a good film - but far from a perfect one. I'm not interested in responding to its Top 250 placement with my review (as countless others have done), but the fact that it has been voted into the number one slot is a reflection of how universal its appeal is: it's about as likable and mass-marketed as possible. There's nothing here to really offend or provoke and the film doesn't take enough changes to potentially polarize audiences -- it plays it safe, and in my opinion, a bit too safe. The film's message of hope and redemption is way too heavy-handed, the outcome being a movie that is very simple and easy to digest -- but not really very interesting beyond its surface. It speaks volumes that so many people who have gone through depression often reference this as one of the aids they used for comfort -- it's a movie that pats people on the back and gives them hope and inspiration. That's a great message, but if you provide it without any challenge to the audience -- and instead just spoon feed it -- well, for me, anyway, it doesn't leave much of an impact. It's just a well-made but manipulative and self-important film. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is with out a doubt one of the most over rated films of the 90s.  There have been many intriguing prison movies over the years, Shawshank is not one of them. Instead it's sentimental slop served to uplift the souls of the American people.  There is never any sense in the film that Tim Robbin's character is in true danger.  If the film wanted to show the true horror of prison maybe it should of been far more darker, instead of inspiration. Morgan Freeman is wasted as usual, in the role of wisdom spouting inmate. Freeman's character is mainly there to look wise and bring inspiration to us all, but he is never treated as a typical person. Tim Robbins is good, but his character is all good, while the prison warden is sure evil. Everything is black and white.  Shawshank has potential to be great, but director Frank Darabant's obsession with being Frank Capra ruins the film at every turn. \n",

      "Shawshank Redemption has been elevated in popular opinion to the status of masterpiece because of one irrefutable virtue. It is accessible. Regrettably, as is true in so many cases, popular opinion is an inaccurate gauge of this picture's actual quality. The reason this film has attained its current level of acclaim is that it is impossible to misinterpret its theme or message, impossible to be offended by it, impossible to be confused by. However, as this review should show, it is entirely possible to be unimpressed by \"Shawshank.\"The story of Shawshank Redemption is something I might expect if I was being pitched a script by middle schoolers. The complex coincidental frameup, the daring escape, the clear cut definitions of good and evil. the timeless friendship finally and uneventfully consummated on a beautiful shoreline. Each step more unsurprising than the last, each beat more clichéd that the last. Every time the filmmakers feel like building tension or revealing something about the characters, they take the most obvious road. This might be excusable if the road didn't also lead to the most obvious destinations.People also praise the acting in the film. While it isn't at all bad, it's hard to be impressed when the actors are playing such simplistic roles. Stereotypes when acted well are still boring.I sincerely hope that over time, when the film has settled into history and once people are more able to set this pandering film along side its heavily plundered predecessors, it will become clear that it offers nothing new, and that what it does offer it doesn't even offer all that well. \n",

      "Shawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made, and definitely the best film of 1994. Yes, it is better than Lion King, and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I seriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The dialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in your mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the script, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books. But in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was exceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a great job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar, that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very strongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean Connery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in Brook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to screen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the exception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course.

There is a romantic glow to the cinematography that is really inappropriate if the main characters are heterosexual. If they aren't there is an unexplored subtext poisoning the base of the movie. There is nothing else about this movie that makes a lick of sense: emotional, dramatic, logical, racial, penological.

There are good performances by Robbins and Freeman, but the pace of the movie is very slow and the cinematography is unremarkable. Characters are largely stereotypes, the story is somewhat formulaic (and sometimes ludicrous), and the noble prisoners vs wicked guards dichotomy is simplistic and unrealistic. I was also particularly annoyed at the narration, which always seemed to explain more than it needed to. As for the ending, I guess I was not as suprised as others since I did read the Stephen King novella many years ago. Still, given that the story takes place in a prison, you don't need to be a genius to guess part of it.This movie reminds me of Dead Poets Society in terms of its tone and theme of uplifting the human spirit against a backdrop of despair.

I suppose in an age where everything on amazon gets at least four stars, good subjective criticism is proving harder and harder to find...but really...is this film better than Chinatown? Better than Casablanca? The Third Man? Mean Streets? Withnail and I? Better than Adam's Rib, Singin' in the Rain, Rear Window, Day for Night, Bande a Part, Taxi Driver, West Side Story, Les Quatre Cent Coups, Some Like it Hot, Seven Samurai?I've seen this film twice, once at the cinema and once on TV as I lie stuffed with Xmas dinner. The first time was mildly enjoyable, the second pretty turgid. Despite the presence of the ever excellent Robbins (though Morgan Freeman phones in the same performance he's given in every film ever since), this film never transcends the humble source of its story - a Stephen King short - and whilst it's a 'nice' tale with a reasonable twist at the end, can anyone else explain to me why such praise has been heaped on this utterly average experience?And it's not just IMDB. A recent UK Channel Four poll found Shawshank right up there. Perhaps it's the combination of pseudo-harsh prison story and a buddy tale along with the lashings of on the nose humanism that appeals across genders and other boundaries. I don't know. But believe me, if this were the 2nd best film ever made in the world ever, let's just say cinema wouldn't be the popular influence it is today.Go out there, people. Find the true 'classics', find the films this piece of sentimentalia stole its every beat, every note, every word of dialogue from.

How Stephen King could come up with a horror story like this is beyond me. It's a real nightmare to be in a penal system with so many things going against you. Personally, I think that Forrest Gump (FG) is also a tale of Hope, but in a different sense. Firstly, FG shows the hope of waiting for the woman you love for over 20 years. Secondly, FG shows that there can be hope for mentally disabled people to continue in society and aim for goals. I think that both movies are great and should not be missed or inappropiately criticised. I also urge people to watch La Vita e bella (Life is beautiful) as it is as good as The Shawshank Redemption and has some similar points.

But The Shawshank Redemption is so... average. And cliché-ridden. The film's moral is basically that hope is important, and there's nothing wrong with that in itself. Heck - I have no problem with simplicity. The problem is when you move past the simple and into the land of the simplistic. The movie treats its borrowed plot parts (Count of Monte Cristo, anyone?) and banal themes as though they were freshly minted nuggets of wisdom. (I wouldn't be complaining if it didn't pretend to be anything more than a pleasant diversion.) However, it is with its very last shot that the movie reveals its true condescending colours. If it had ended moments earlier instead, with that poetic shot of the sea, I would have had some respect for it (that's where the superior original story ends). But no, the director had to spell things out for his audience. Frank Darabont knows how to tell a story. He just doesn't know how to tell one with any originality or depth.The movie is partially redeemed by three things.

In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who was imprisoned many years earlier. Red gets Andy a poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the next twenty years, Andy experiences all the horrors that one would expect in jail: beatings by the guards, rapes by other inmates, and so on. But he never gives up hope.This movie, like \"Carrie\", \"The Shining\", \"Dolores Claiborne\", \"The Green Mile\" and \"Hearts in Atlantis\", just goes to show what a great author Stephen King is. When we think of horror, we think of spooky horror, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a different kind: personal horror. Pure genius. I can only hope that in the coming years, this movie is recognized as what it is: a masterpiece. I can't believe that it won no Oscars! \n",

      "Shawshank Redemption is one of those infamous movies you never stop hearing about if you are a crazed movie fanatic. I've been through the entire top 250 list up and down and this is going back and fourth between #2 and #3 struggling with Lord of the Rings: The Retrun of the King. I had to see this movie to see what all the fuss is about.Based on Stephen King's novel, The Shawshank Redemption is a terrific adaptation of his book. The acting, I mean don't get me started. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were perfectly casted and fit so well together. What I mean in my title to my summary is, I felt that I could relate. This reminded me so much of my friendship with my best friend, because her and I are so close and would do anything for each other. Even wait until the end of time just to hang out and talk again.I felt this story also brought up major important points, what does a convict do after so many years in prison? Pretty much a good job is out of the question, same with a decent place. Your family might disown you and everything you knew was in that prison. It's sort of like being shoved from a lake to an ocean and you're drowning with no life preserver. This movie actually got me thinking about that.Also there is the final notion of the court systems, because we are also dealing with Tim Robbin's life. He keeps claiming his innocence and no one will listen to him or believe him. I felt awful for him, I know there are a lot of men and women in prison who are innocent and are paying for other people's crimes.I would highly recommend The Shawshank Redemption, I believe it's better than Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. So watch it and understand this movie, it's important. This should be watched by everyone and you get out of the movie what you bring into it.10/10 \n",

      "Good acting from all concerned carries the rather simplistic and obvious storyline beyond the saccharine, but the villains are really predictable in their villany and the storyline, while initially moving and affecting, seems forced and unreal once you step back from Robbins and Freeman's performances.In other words, a high impact movie that rapidly loses credibility with considered thought after viewing. Far more worthwhile, though, than many other similarly stretched dramas and by no means a failure. But by no means in the top rank of movie making. \n",

The only thing my spouse has been able to glean from researching the topic on the internet is that psychologically people seem to like the film more and more upon repeated viewings. Well, that and Morgan Freeman's calming voice. Not that challenging cinematically and a bit of a fantasy that pawns itself off as gritty realism, to be honest. Not to be an alarmist, but part of me wonders whether this film would be Exhibit A should the country ever descend into a fascist dictatorship much like \"From Caligari to Hitler\" by Siegfried Kracauer examined German film during the rise of the Nazi's after World War I. There is something going on on a group psychology level here that bears examination. \n",

      "The Count of Monte Cristo isn't a very good book, and has spawned a few pretty poor films, but it's the ideas which make it an enduring story. Now whether Stephen King was consciously inspired by Dumas's (\"Dumass's\") book when writing the original short story I don't know - what I do know is that Frank Darabont took a dour, typically coarsely-detailed potboiler and evolved it into something special. The big step for me, was that having taken an interesting idea and made it good, Darabont then found an ensemble cast and a cinematographer who could make it sing. I don't think there's a dull line of dialogue in the movie, and barely a camera shot either out of place or wasted. Why it is that equally talented filmmakers can spend millions and produce the kind of mindless gibberish which actually wins Oscars (like 'Braveheart' did in the year 'Shawshank Redemption' was nominated) I'll truly never fathom. Maybe there should be another way of formally recognising talent: wait ten years then take a vote - that way the mindless and the popular will have time to find their level and what's left is worth remembering. \n",

What the hell, why not make it #3 on IMDb? It too is competent and utterly middle-of-the road in terms of quality and originality within its genre.Instead of Dan Ackroyd and Eddie Murphy laughing it up on a Caribbean beach after besting the forces of evil, we get Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.

      "Quite frankly, this is a movie of clichés. You want examples, I got examples! \"Some birds are not meant to be caged, their feathers are too bright\" or \"Get busy living, or get busy dying\" or \"Terrible thing, to live in fear\" or \"It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made those walls dissolve away\" or \"need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone\" or \"Hope is a good thing, and good things can never die\" - if you say so, sensei!Problem is Stephen King never leaves anything to the imagination. He tells us everything - if Tim Robbins organises some special event for the inmates, like playing music over the loudspeaker, Morgan Freeman's voice will come right out and suggest a few reasons why this episode is so wonderful/significant, the nature of which are very similar through each episode of the movie. And Darabont obviously likes the idea of assuming the audience are very thick, and will not see or experience anything unless you dictate to them what to experience, and has made his movie by it.Also, i'm starting to be wary of Thomas Newman as a composer doing exactly what Darabont has done as a director: employ a formula that has worked in the past. His score for Shawshank is calculated on the same formula of highs, lows, and general atmosphere as in his score for Road to Perdition, American Beauty, Meet Joe Black, Horse Whisperer, Scent of a Woman, and The Green Mile, not surprisingly. If you think about all these movies, they all have a similar feel, they all go for a similar nostalgia, haunting sadness - which admittedly i find very appealing, but i'm starting to worry at how similar they all are.I think encouraging this movie too much is like rewarding someone for employing a formula very successfully - instead of taking risks and doing something edgy that still turns out to be enjoyable and brilliant. Most people do not evaluate movies based on their IMDb ranking, but i certainly would be surprised if any major lists ranked this in their top ten.That said, this is still a good movie, with good performances, a good unity, despite its necessarily episodic nature, and it looks great. Its only for movies people insist on putting on best-ever lists that i require a certain originality, the feeling that what this movie gives you you could not get anywhere else (I believe this is why movies like Citizen Kane, Vertigo, 2001, Raging Bull, Third Man, Grand Illusion, Persona and, for me, Exterminating Angel, are constantly mentioned on such lists, and deservedly). What this movie gave me, I could get from reading any other Stephen King story, or seeing any other movie adaptation of a King story. \n",

Yeah, I know you Americans love the happy-ending Vaseline-flavored subtly homosexual jail movies, but all this hype it's too much anyway. Come on, this can't be better than Welles, Kubrick, Kurosawa or Scorsese (or not even Carpenter and Fulci in my humble opinion) So I give it a 1/10. This is not a critical valuation of the movie.

It was certainly entertaining enough, and very well-acted, but also way over-long, and filled with the usual stock characters that seem to inhabit every prison drama (if Hollywood movies are to be believed, prison wardens are mainly just nasty SOB's and the inmates are just the best bunch of guys you'd ever want to meet).

The theme of success against the odds is rarely so emotive, and the desperate hope and yearning are truly palpable.But it's simply NOT the best film of all time! Parts of it are cliched, most of it is downright implausible. The symbolism is trite and way too in-your-face, particularly with Freeman explicitly spelling out (albeit touchingly) what should have been the movie's duty to portray.The ending was a shameless exercise in trying to make the world feel better than it's ever felt before.

      "I found this movie to be rather trivial and predictable.  It was, in many ways, a Forrest Gump version of a prison movie.  It had a manipulative and superficial plotline, and the leading character was too good to be true. It never dealt deeply with any issue at all.  Basically, you liked the leading character because he was perfect, and cheered him on and hoped for his success, just like Forrest Gump.  However, unlike Forrest Gump, I could never see the true emotion of the Tim Robbins character.  He didn't like being sexually assaulted, but we never saw how that affected him; he didn't drink but got beers for his friends.  He finds pleasure out of the simple things and doesn't like unpleasurable things.  He turned out to be a perfect character with no negative qualities at all.  Maybe he's this way for a reason; people can relate to him because they like to think of themselves being completely perfect and think they would make every right decision if they were in a situation like this.In many senses, this was just a morality play, with Andy Dufresne being entirely good and all the prison officials being completely bad.  I think the only reason why people enjoy this movie so much is that it has the message \"Good things come to those that try and do good with their lives.\" However, I didn't think the movie had enough substance to offer any deeper meaning or insight.  The best thing about this movie was it made me realize how great of a movie Forrest Gump is and how great of an actor Tom Hanks is. He made the Forrest Gump character seem to have a fully round personality and allowed us to understand who he was.  He seemed possible.  Andy seems unlikely and not relatable because we never see any reasoning behind his personality.This movie moves people because it is a heroic fable.  It's not a worthless movie experience, but it should have done more with what it already had. To the people that think this is the greatest movie ever made...spare me. My rating 4/10. \n",

I think the only reason this movie is #2 on this list is the sheer amount of people who have seen it and voted. The other truly great movies near the top of the list don't pack the same mass audience appeal that Shawshank Redemption does, nor are they shown on TNT 6-10 times a year. Movies like 2001, The Seven Samurai, or Lawrence of Arabia, for example, would bore many of the people who love Shawshank Redemption, and I personally consider those three I named and many others to be far better creations than the Shawshank Redemption.

      "The great Morgan Freeman continues to spin out superlative performances. This is one of his finest, a difficult and complex portrayal of a veteran convict, who is so long a part of the numbing prison culture that we're somewhat surprised by his sympathetic understanding of the unfortunate Andy DuFresne, movingly interpreted by Tim Robbins. People are in prison, for the most part, because they belong there. Prisoners don't normally exude compassion for their fellow unfortunates, but Freeman's \"Red\" noticed right away that DuFresne was of different stuff. Their friendship cut across both racial and social lines, and that it was forged in the furnace of a prison conducted by so corrupt a warden as Norton, was a magnificent testimony to their bond. Clancy Brown as the warden's personal storm trooper could have been reduced to caricature, but he turned this difficult role into a memorable portrayal of mindless violence. The great revelation in this film was Bob Gunton as the warden. There has rarely been, if ever in film, a keener reading of a character given the charge of men who've been reviled by society, and thus forgotten and who are totally dependent upon his good will for their very survival. Norton was the essential bureaucrat who, given sufficient backing from an indifferent public, can build from the foundations up, a system which brutalizes and murders men, and which exploits the last vestiges of their self-respect for his personal ends. The narration by Freeman in his great baritone lent an authentic base line for the kaleidoscopic unfolding of the film. James Whitmore's poignant turn as a man doomed to death outside of prison is proof of what lengthy incarceration to do to a man, turning him into a slave who is addicted to the very structure which denies his humanity. That both DuFrense and \"Red\" each managed to leap over the abysses which yawned before them, was the great cathartic experience of the film. \n",

      "Shawshank Redemption is overrated. It's a decent, above average film, but by no means a great film.The inmates are pretty much likeable, while the warden and his pet guard are monsters. Also as Freeman's character says: \"You know that everybody in here's innocent?\" As the story develops you feel like he is right, the only criminals are the ones guarding the prisoners.This is a sentimental piece made to stir the emotions, but not to stir them too much. Just enough to make the viewer feel there is injustice in the world but that in the end everything ends well and justice surely comes to he who waits 20 years or so for it.The Shawshank Redemption is, as I said, a decent film, possibly among the top five films of 1994. IMO the best films of 1994 are Pulp Fiction and Léon. \n",

That's the only explanation.  This movie offers nothing special: nothing different, nothing unique.

The direction is nothing to write home about, the cinematography is, frankly, standard.  The script has Steven King written all over it - a melodramatic plot involving the woes of an educated bloke told in overwrought dialogue full of clumsy metaphors.  (A good example: the moment when the scriptwriter decided that the prisoner's interest in geology had to be spelled out for the dumber members of the audience \"It's all about TIME and PRESSURE...\" just in case anyone managed to miss the connection). Morgan Freeman is, as usual, superb but Tim Robbins is inconsistent as a man who goes from being the gaol newcomer to an old hand.

Along with good performances around the board. The simple staging and lighting of the film is over-done in it's simplicity and I personally see no art in it at all. But, I'm not saying it's a bad film. It's not, and it's far from it. But to be ranked over vastly more intelligent efforts is a sad reflection on our society.\n",

I am no huge fan of visual effects or quick paced story-telling ... but I am a fan of art. Reading a book would be as enthralling as watching this film. Seeing the acting is like watching lines being delivered, but being delivered well.As for it's rating on the site ... the film pushes no boundaries in which film often offends people to the point of disliking it. It has a nice uplifting story at the end and presses a lot of hot buttons. Including murder, infidelity, and scandal. Searching for the soundtrack for this film is what brought me to IMDb for the first time, actually.

Every other second i was hearing violins about how this poor guy got landed in jail for a murder he didn't commit. It's stereotypical - and you guys who voted 10 bought it hook, line and sinker. \"But what about the great twist?\" O.k., the twist was good but come on...like i said before was it THAT great? Ask yourselves honestly, was that better than The Sixth Sense's or The Usual Suspects? Also, how come foreign films which are far superior to this get no credit?

Sure it contains very good performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman- but there have been other, much better screen performances by other actors. There is very little suspense or originality about the plot and nothing that hasn't been seen or done on screen a hundred times before. So why the popularity? It's a formulaic feel-good movie who's happy ending is never in doubt. Knowing that Stephen King wrote the novel on which the film was based would probably give that away anyway. As with any adaptation from book to film there are several differences between the two, though the film does, on this occasion, improve on the book.There have been better adaptations of King novels (The Shining) and better performances by better actors, yet for some reason this film continues to be rated as better than it actually is. \n",

There's hardly anything special about the movie, let alone breathtaking, intriguing or groundbreaking. The beginning is somewhat promising, but pretty soon it all gets painfully predictable right down to the moment the credits start rolling. The narrative is way too often overdrawn and phoney, the music - heavily pretentious and irritating. The performances are not bad, but let's face it - the script is far from demanding. The storytelling is overwhelmingly fairytale-ish and even the drastic bits seem oddly out of the place, as if thrown in to make the thing feel more dramatic. Words keep flowing in abundance, soothingly creating the impression of a nap story told by a lit fireplace. Having recently watched the ingenious \"The Straight Story\" I was astonished to see how much damage may be done to a picture by putting in too much talk.All that is not to say the movie is appaling. However, an inch above average is as good as it gets. Both \"Midnight Express\" and \"Escape From Alcatraz\" beat the weepy Shawshank experience hands down. 6/10. \n",

      "Originally, I wrote a very long review of Shawshank Redemption, but i've decided not to post it.  Instead i'd just like to say that i would compare the movie to a poem that i wrote in 5th grade.  i'm not going to write the poem out because i don't have it with me right now, but it had to do with rainbows and waterfalls and following your dreams. In other words, it was complete b.s. I just wrote what i thought were some typical poetic themes and threw them together, hoping people would like it.  My plan succeeded, the teacher thought it was the best in the class, and it got published in the school newspaper. Seems like the director of The Shawshank Redemption, Frank Darabont, and the writer of the book, Stephen King, did the same thing.  The movie is technically well made and does succeed at telling the story.  I admit that I got caught up in the ending.  But no matter how much you try to defend it, it's still pure Hollywood.  Cliche here and there.  I recognize this for what it is:  a director's attempt to manipulate people's emotions, which, due to a large amount of naivite in the world, succeeds.  He did the same thing with The Green Mile with more success.  Now, with The Majestic, I am glad to see that it seems that most reviewers and many moviegoers have recognized this, and given it generally lower reviews than his first two films.  Finally!  Now I only hope people will start to give Shawshank lower ratings and get it down from the heights of the top 250 list. \n",

      "I quite like this film but it wouldn't make my top 100. The idea it's the greatest film in history is laughable.Of course the acting's terrific. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are solid as ever, even if Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown (the Baddies) chew the scenery. And that's the problem - everything is so terribly black and white, with every character springing straight out of a three word summary. Our hero is Good But Flawed, Red is Good And Noble, the Warden is Just Plain Bad and his henchman is Reminiscent Of Another Film (okay, four words).I've never been inside a prison, but I can't believe all the prisoners would be so damn nice. There's the \"sisters\" - a bunch of horrid rapists, of course, but they're nothing a small plot contrivance can't eliminate. The \"sisters\" aside, there's nary a cross word from a prisoner in the whole film.Racism is also curiously absent. American prisons today are notorious hot-beds of racism. Martin Luther King's dream is bizarrely alive and well in Shawshank, where colour doesn't get a mention in twenty years of \"history\".This total lack of realism means it's not really a film about prison at all. And what kind of \"character\" film can be centred around someone who seems entirely flawless (other than perhaps in his choice of attorney).I can whinge about the mechanics of the film as well. Voiceover narration is irritating enough - but Red narrating events at which he was not present? Pur-lease. And that final scene - talk about a director who didn't know when to shout \"cut\". It didn't need much self control to stop at the point Red heads towards Mexico - films for grown-ups shouldn't need endings that resolve any uncertainty.Speaking of the director, isn't it odd how the maker of the \"Greatest film in the world ever\" is also credited for The Fan, Eraser, The Blob and The Fly II? It's as if Orson Welles directed \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\", or Francis Ford Copolla helmed \"Megaforce\".I don't mean to make this out to be a bad film - it's far from that. But anyone who rates it the greatest ever should try \"Godfather\", \"Goodfellas\", \"Citizen Kane\", \"Casablanca\" - something, anything that's not so *worthy*. \n",

Certainly the portrayal of the brutality of the guards during those times I would say is fairly realistic.The one part of the story where an old timer gets released does ring true.

However, it displays what i see as typical for King's work. When he's writing science fiction, fantasy or horror it all sits well. But when he writes anything that should mirror reality it simply feels fake in the same way as wearing a cotton shirt and the one made of synthetics feels different.

Slowly it has become one of the most popular movies of all time - and, for some, it has even been life- changing. It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks.

      "The Shawshank Redemption is currently number one on the IMDb Top 250 list. I don't particularly agree with that, but it is a truly great movie nonetheless. It is moving and compelling, and it touches the heart and soul.The story is set in the 1940s, and it involves Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins), a young man who is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in the Shawshank Prison. As one would expect, he is very unhappy at first, but then he leans that there's something deeper that nobody can take away from you: hope. As the story unfolds, over the years, Andy eventually becomes very influential within the prison and gains the respect of other inmates, especially \"Red\" (Morgan Freeman), with whom he develops a special friendship.The story isn't original or creative, and it's relatively simple, and a bit predictable, but it's compelling, moving, and memorable, and there's a bit more to it which I won't go into. The movie puts the viewer right into the footsteps, experiences, and emotions of the characters. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman put on great performances. They really bring out their characters and offer true depth and emotion. One of the major moral messages of the movie is that a person may be imprisoned, even for life, but the spirit can never truly be imprisoned.

I was channel surfing one evening - and stumbled across this movie. I watched a few minutes, thinking I would change channels at the first commercial. Almost 2 hours later - after seeing the end - I sat there...saying \"Wow\". That was a great movie. I have since recommended it to friends and family...it has grown in popularity due to word of mouth - and certainly deserves its spot at the top. Morgan Freeman put on a masterful performance, as did Tim Robbins. The way their friendship develops and the interplay with the other inmates - a wonderful story.If you have not watched this movie yet - put preconceived notions aside, sit down, and enjoy the journey! \n",

      "Hi, I heard details about this movie first time two years ago from a friend. Before that in some movie channels I used to see the title been shown but never saw it. A jail movie....slow..not for me.I was in college those days in the nineties. In 2007 when my friend told me that whenever he feel sad or down he thinks of this movie and moves on. I replied back 'for me its rocky', he asked if I have seen it and when I told him that I did not, the only answer he had was it..watch it and then compare it. Now in 2009 with the recession going on, lots of trouble in work and tensions of home and personal life for me. While changing channels, I chanced upon this movie which had started and I had lost some ten minutes. I did not change the channels later and saw it in complete. The only reaction was tears in my eyes in the end and called my family and close friends. It was a shaking experience, and I got my answer....I needed to get out of my jail. I sent mails to my friends about the movie and review, few had seen it already and many did not. Result, more people watched it...and guess what I for the first time rated in this website for the movie. ..AND i expect some of my friends also did it. This is the reason why after 15 years this movie is still alive because of its human spirit story....with more followers than fans. I hope that answers some of your doubts...... This movie is for those who are busy dying......and now know its important to get busy living. \n",

      "I am so happy to see this film top 1 in IMDb. It deserves to be there. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" appears in 1994, I think this year was full of amazing pictures. It lost Oscars but gained recognition. This is a great story about friendship and redemption. Frank Darabont's best movie for sure. Andy Dufresne is one of the greatest characters ever made in the cinema art. A guy who is innocent and get punished. This film shows us that even our intention is a crime in a legal world. No one is perfect, and no one can predict anything. We live by a scheme and trying to be fair. People will always make mistakes and the greatest thing is to learn from them. I am waiting for movies which can touch me like this one but after the year 2000 nothing close to that appears. There were great films about life and stuff but still, it's a modification, a copy thereof what was before. I think until the year 2000 most of the valuable things in film art was told. It's a little sad but this kind of art will always be deep in my heart as a lesson and beauty how fantastic picture man create. I hope there will be at least couple movies in my short life that leave so many emotions like \"The Shawshank Redemption\". In XXI century it is a very hard thing to do. I am patient and have positive thinking that cinema didn't say the last words. \n",

      "I was literally HOOKED. No wonder this film is rated amongst the best ever. This is definitely one of the best movies you will see your entire life. Morgan Freeman's narration was awesome. Tim Robbins powerfully illustrates the importance of HOPE. All the characters did a superb job. This is surely one of my all time favourite movies. Its a classic & a true masterpiece of cinema... Don't think! Just watch & savour it.I saw the following comment by someone and thought of adding it to mine, I agree 100% to everything of the following: \"Many people in this world are unhappy. Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy. Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all. They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer. To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow. Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairy tales don't come true. It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist. And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him. Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score. It's about Red. He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope. He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going. Hope is, as Red say, dangerous. The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it. A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer. Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do. They're too busy living.\"Just a little piece of advice to everyone who hated/disliked this film; Believe me this film is made for multiple viewings...Don't hate this after viewing it once or twice, give it at least more than 2 viewings before you make up your mind. I'm POSITIVE it will become more and more better after each viewing and probably you will end up loving it. If not, maybe it was just not your Cup Of Tea. I hope this film satisfies everyone and I really don't care if its No.1 on the IMDb or outside Top250. Its not fair to hate a film because your favourite is not above it in the rankings!Its a deeply satisfying movie that makes you understand the importance of HOPE.9.8/10P.S. Technically{all round film-making} it may not be the greatest movie of all-time{that honor can go to Godfather/LOTR:ROTK/Star Wars 4,etc.} BUT it certainly goes down in my book as one of the finest and a movie to savour for ages. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is an excellent film from director Frank Darabont whose admirable in making this story based on a book by Stephen King. Tim Robbins gives a great performance as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman is equally impressive as Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding two imprisoned men looking for redemption who bond after many years while dealing with not only the abusive corrupt prison guards but the violent fellow prisoners amongst them as well. Robbins and Freeman had good chemistry together which made their growing friendship that much more believable on the screen. The rest of the cast including Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The pacing was a little slow at times and the running time of 142 minutes made the film feel a bit long but the rest made up for it's few flaws. Overall despite it's flaws The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a must see a movie that can't be missed. It has a compelling story, character development, drama, some humor, and exceptional performances by the cast (especially Robbins and Freeman) who make this one of the best books by Stephen King that was made into a movie. Well done. Much better than expected. \n",

Unlike in most other Hollywood films, the twists in the storyline are very well executed and it is in no ways cheesy or cheap.

      "The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most touching and greatest movies I have ever seen. The movie is based on the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. Unlike most of his novels King didn't write a horror story but instead a inspiring tale of hope in unlikely places. Overseeing the transition from book to big screen is Frank Darabont who in his director debut scores a home run with this movie.Not only does the plot pull you in but the actors do as well. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do a fantastic job as the 2 central characters and as friends. Bob Gunton is great in the part of the villain as the evil warden. The directing, cast, and plot all combine to make the movie awesome.The plot of the movie revolves around Andy Dufresne a man who is imprisoned for life for a crime he did not commit. Over time Andy becomes friends with Red an inmate who runs the business of smuggling in things into the prison. The story then follows the 2 and how they handle prison life.Years go by but Andy continues to speak of hope. Ultimately Andy will commit unbelievable acts in a touching story that is truly inspirational. The message the story delivers is to never give up hoping. The climax of the movie is fantastic and the ending is one of the greatest in film history.Overall the Shawshank Redemption remains one of the greatest films of all time. \n",

      "The story of this film takes place over a twenty-year period between 1947 and 1967. Andy Dufresne, a young banker from Portland, Maine, is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life imprisonment. (\"Shawshank\" is the name of the prison where he serves his sentence). The prison is a brutal place, and Andy is frequently beaten and sexually assaulted by a gang of homosexual inmates called \"The Sisters\". Two things, however, help him to survive. One is his friendship with another convict, Red, who has a reputation for being able to acquire almost any item and, for a price, to smuggle it into the prison. The other is his financial expertise, which he puts to good use, becoming a tax and financial adviser to the prison guards and even the Warden himself. As a reward for these services, Andy is given a privileged job in the prison library and protection from molestation. To avenge their attacks on Andy, the leader of the \"Sisters\" is so badly beaten by the guards that he is crippled for life; Andy is not molested again.The Warden devises a scheme under which inmates are put to work on local construction projects. The purpose of this is ostensibly to prepare them for life after they are released, but in reality he is exploiting their free labour for his own personal profit, and using Andy's financial skills to launder the proceeds. This arrangement seems to work to Andy's advantage, because of the extra privileges he is granted, but things change when a new young prisoner named Tommy Williams is sent to Shawshank. Tommy has evidence that could secure Andy's release; a former cellmate in another prison has confessed to him that he committed the murders for which Andy was convicted. Tommy confides this secret to the Warden who, fearing that his illegal schemes will be revealed should Andy ever be released, arranges to have Tommy murdered by a corrupt guard.There is a long history of American prison films, including the likes of \"I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\", \"Cool Hand Luke\", \"Brubaker\" and the more recent \"The Last Castle\". (Frank Darabont was later to direct another prison film, \"The Green Mile\", based, like \"The Shawshank Redemption\" on a Stephen King story). Most of these were made with a liberal social agenda in mind, aiming to expose the harsh prison conditions and thereby inspire their reform. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" falls, to some extent, within this tradition; it is made from a basically liberal viewpoint and vividly depicts the brutality of prison life, although the fact that it is a period piece, set several decades in the past, might suggest that social issues were not the filmmakers' sole concern. Perhaps more important are the analysis of the nature of freedom and of the relationship between Andy and Red.The word \"prison\", from the French \"pris\" (\"taken\"), merely indicates a place where captives are held, and the authorities, especially in America, prefer to describe many prisons by some more positive term such as \"penitentiary\" or \"reformatory\" which implies their purpose of rehabilitating criminals. Shawshank, a prison where the Warden and guards are at least as crooked as the inmates, has precisely the opposite effect. Andy goes in innocent of any crime and comes out guilty of being an accessory to corruption and fraud. Yet, despite his involvement in the Warden's dishonesty, Andy retains a certain integrity; he refuses to give up hope and refuses to allow himself to be beaten by the system. Although he is in prison he has found a sort of freedom. A key moment comes when he defies the guards to play a Mozart aria over the prison loudspeakers for all the inmates to hear- a reminder of spiritual values even in the harshest of environments.Red faces a different problem. He fears that he has become so institutionalised that he will be unable to survive freedom, as happened to another long-term prisoner who committed suicide shortly after his release. In prison, his role as the \"fixer\" who can obtain anything, be it a packet of cigarettes, a rock hammer or a poster of Rita Hayworth, makes him the king of the inmates. (These latter two items will play an important role in the plot). On the outside he will be just another ex-con trying to make ends meet in a dead-end job. Paradoxically, he is more free in jail than he will be on the outside. I won't give away the ending, but it involves Andy repaying Red's previous kindnesses by showing him how he can be free in all senses of the word.The film was not a great box office success when first released but has since acquired a status as one of the classics of the modern American cinema; it has now supplanted \"The Godfather\" as number one on IMDb's Top 250 list. The film would perhaps not be number one on my personal list, but it is a fine one and would certainly be in my top 250, perhaps the top 100. Its two stars, Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red, are both excellent. Its initial lack of success may have had something to do with its rather clumsy title. \"Shawshank\" is not a word that will mean anything to the average person (according to one story Darabont was once asked how his \"rickshaw\" film was going) and \"redemption\", except in technical legal contexts, normally has a religious connotation. This is not an explicitly religious film; indeed, in its portrayal of Warden Norton as a sanctimonious, Bible-bashing hypocrite, it can be seen as critical of religion. Nevertheless, the word \"redemption\" is perhaps appropriate in this context, after undergoing the hell of Shawshank Andy and Red manage to find a sort of secular redemption. It may be this message of hope that accounts for the film's continuing popularity. 9/10 \n",

      "This is without a doubt one of the finest films of the last 20 years. I think that if it had been released with more fanfare and didn't have such great competition that year, it might have won for Best Picture. This film has such a powerful presence that it has a life of it's own apart from the cast, score, cinematography, etc., all of which are deservedly great. This is one of those movies that you can switch to when you are channel surfing, and stop and watch the rest of it, no matter what part of the movie you are at. Perhaps The Godfather and Jaws are a couple of others that do that for me, and it never gets old, no matter how many times you watch it. One thing that disappoints me regarding this film is what has happened to the director, Frank Darabont. Unfortunately, he has never come close to achieving the greatness of Shawshank with his subsequent films. I thought The Green Mile was good, but it didn't hold a candle to Shawshank. I was also very disappointed in The Mist. I sincerely hope that he is able to recapture some of the magic of Shawshank Redemption in a future film, because he definitely does have the proved ability to do so. \n",

      "In short supply are the movies which act as cathartic catalysts on a second –or-plus viewing as compellingly and strongly as on the first viewing. The other night, overpowered by feelings of despondency and ennui, I went to flick through my small collection of movies and on an impulse I picked up The Shawshank Redemption. I savored every moment of the movie even more than my first time a couple of years ago. I chalk it up to its beautifully crafted story, its virtuoso and powerhouse performances, and its underlying themes of hope, resolve, and ultimate salvation. This time, in his feature directorial debut Frank Darabont has tapped into the wellspring of King the horrible's and fashioned a juggernaut of a prison drama out of his novella Rita Hayworth and the shawshank Redemption. This movie stands out among other prison flicks in that it flies in the face of conventions. Contrary to our expectations and cheapened tastes, Shawshank does not intend to explore the horrors of prison life as its fulcrum but the way its inhabitants clutch at straws and pull out all stops to extricate themselves from the shackles of the gloom of their claustrophobic mental incarceration against all the odds turns out to be its thematic pull. And the movie pulls it off big time. Among a mosaic of characters, events, shenanigans and skullduggery, the movie mainly delves into the friendship struck up between two lifers. The friendship between Andy Dufresne, played convincingly by Tim Robbins, who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to serve two concurrent lives, and the veteran Red, the brilliant Morgan Freeman, carries the emotional and inspirational mood of the movie. When a busload of prisoners arrive at the max-security state penitentiary of Shawshank, the other felons bet on who is going to burst into tears at the first night of prison life. Red ups his antes on the seemingly brittle fresh fish Andy, who was a respectable banker in the outside and is like a fish out of water among a bunch of thick-skinned miscreants. Red loses since Andy turns out to be more redoubtable and impermeable than any prison wall several feet thick. Little do the fellow prisoners realize at first glance what an enigmatic character he is. For the first months he says next to nothing, meanders through other prisoners in the prison yard minding his own business and the movie speaks through by-turn humorous, poignant and thought-provoking narration of the omniscient Red who is known for smuggling things in and charging a 20% markup for the services he provides. However, Red's omniscience is not all-encompassing and Godly enough to bore into the Sphinx-like mind of the introverted Andy even after 19 years. On a tarring occasion, he overhears a guard complaining about the taxes he has to pay for an inheritance, he screws up his courage to offer him his expert advice on tax evasion. Now, he is treated as a special guest since he cooks the books for the prisons' powers that be who have hit pay dirt. His financial legerdemain proves to be a double-edged sword. Now he is the victim of his own success. A newcomer is willing to testify to his innocence in the court but the warden regards his accountant too valuable to be expendable. Andy survives several assaults and rapes. He never gives up. He never cracks under pressure. Life is very simple to him: get busy living or get busy dying. He makes the first choice and remains true to it through thick and thin. He lives with hope as his source of salvation. The emotional pull of the movie owes a great deal to the spirited and flawless performances of all the cast members. Morgan Freeman effortlessly inhabits his character as a real free man. Tim Robbins is superlative as a quintessential embodiment of hope and inspiration. James Whitmore, as the institutionalized prison trusty who is suicidal in the outside, turns in a superlative performance. Hats off to all the performers. The Shawshank Redemption is a prime example of the gap between the box office performance of a movie and its popularity. This movie famously bombed in the box office, barely covering its budget. But overtime it gained in such popularity that it has snatched the coveted toppest ranking place in IMDb from such hot favorites and topdogs like Godfather, Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction, the last two of which eclipsed Shawshank in 1994 Academy Awards. Perhaps in 1994 the movie lacked the requisite word of mouth that it is enjoying now. All in all, Shawshank is a compulsively watchable movie with bits of pleasure withheld in every watching only to be relished on next occasions. \n",

      "Every time I watch The Shawshank Redemption it reinforces the fact that it is my favorite movie of all time. But certainly as entertaining a film that it is, being a personal favorite does not necessarily make it a great film or dare I saythe greatest film ever made.But what then makes a film great? First and foremost, if it sets out to entertain the general public, it must do that (and Shawshank certainly does that). Its pure entertainment value is essentially a stipulation in its inclusion in the great IMDb \"greatest movie\" debate. The serious nature of its central plot pointsa wrongly convicted murderer who assists the corrupt warden as means to affect his own escapeis contrasted by some truly funny scenes. Although by no means a comedy, the splendid screenplay is wrought with witty dialog. There's nothing fancy about this filmno special effects, spectacular scenery or even a bunch of pretty women. No, its just the telling of a story, mostly through the narration of Morgan Freeman's character, Red, that almost lulls viewers into believing that nothing really interesting or important is going to happen here. But after all of the subtle plot twists I think what makes this film great for me is I feel like I'm actually sharing in Andy's redemption. Now if that isn't what they teach in Film-making 101 then they should just close up the classroom.Ultimately, there cannot be a single motion picture that is the \"greatest film of all time\" because as art, and in an art form as varied as cinema, greatness must be measured by each individual. Greatness, as beauty, truly is in the eye of the beholder. But in this beholder's eyes I think The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film I have ever seen. \n",

As a rock hammer, Andy chisels the prison around him. But this is more than the story of Andy and his way out of prison. It's a tale of society, men trying to survive trying to remain human and civilized. Red is a gentleman masterfully played by on of the greatest actors ever. His character adds depth to the story and makes room for hope, for friendship. All those around Andy benefit from his morals, his intelligence, his perseverance, his will not to let go of himself. At first we see men with no hope, no way out of their walls. Brooks is an unfortunate part of it. But Andy changes lives. Some study, some begin to plan life outside the walls.

But I hold it as probably the single most important feature in movies in most cases.

      "I'm a big Stephen King fan, and I wondered if this movie would be a good adaptation. Some of King's work has been great on film, but others have not translated well. No fear. As others have noted, this is an amazing film that provides inspiration and reconnects the viewer with the inner core of humanity. The script is great, the directing is wonderful, and the performances are unbelievably good. To give you some idea of just HOW GOOD this is, the first time I saw it was on an airline. Problem was, the headset didn't work and there weren't any other headsets. The movie is so good that I couldn't stop watching it--and this is a movie heavy on dialogue. If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor. NOTE: It's even better with the sound!!! \n",

      "Don't know how many will ever see the 2,086th comment in this site - but just saw a friend's DVD of this film, again. I had missed it due to being in Europe on an extended business trip when it played first-run, and caught some portions of it a few years later, and then completely sometime following.This was the third or fourth time I'd seen it straight through, and it is one of those very rare films which is as good - maybe even better - on successive viewings.Robbins, Freeman, Gunton, and all of the remaining cast - whether in larger supporting roles or smaller - are outstanding, without a single exception.My friend is a computer whiz, with an IQ of probably 150, and widely-expert expert in this area. But he's so immersed in this realm, that whenever forced to use pen and paper (instead of mouse or keyboard) he does so on about the 5th-grade level. After the film (he had bought the DVD, but had never seen it before) he stated he didn't feel the Robbins character could have pulled-off all the shenanigans with the money, from prison via mail (and perhaps sometimes using a messenger of the warden's) the way the film depicted -- whereas today, if such an inmate had a computer terminal available, it would be more possible.I told him I felt certain the opposite was true. In the era of the story, a very intelligent financially-adept individual - especially a former whiz-kid bank V.P. - could have done what was shown even more effectively and successfully than via computer today, with all the firewalls, and in-house computer nerds any bank has. Someone with both tremendous financial and hacker ability might - but not as easily as Tim did, during a period when signatures and figures on paper and the like were the governing elements.This aspect is one of the most critical and climactic for the story and its very satisfying ending. And Gunton, a tremendous actor who has done many sympathetic characters, presents one of the best performances portraying a truly evil person - more so for the quieter and \"nasty-nice\" elements of this portrayal. He juxtaposes quiet demeanor, often even pious, with completely selfish, vicious, amoral actions, as well as humanly possible, with his performance in this roleThis is a film for which the term \"perfect piece of entertainment\" does not exaggerate. \n",

      "Shawshank Redemption gives the feel of a strong, firm and amazing story that can move people while sitting down to watch it. The characters are memorable. Morgan Freeman as Red will always be in my head. Tim Robbins and Any Dufrense, is amazing as well. Shawshank gives the audience a taste of a perfect movie. Movies like this don't come often. Movies come with strong stories, but acting, and flow of this story can mess it up. Shawshank doesn't disappoint. The acting is superb, and the flow of the story is unforgettable. Based on the Stephen King novel, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, I'd say this is one of the movies where the film triumphs over the novel. The film also brings a sense of humor, which is a very good tool for films like these, because if everything is serious, it's very possible that it might be killed. Well, people have their own opinion. One scene amazes me, and probably is one of my favorite scenes in the film is when the prisoners are watching Gilda, and they're all waiting for Rita Hayworth to do the thing with her hair. It still makes me laugh and pleased, with the acting and reactions of the prisoner, and the beauty of Rita Hayworth herself. Shawshank Redemption is a one-of-a-kind film, where stories come in, and the film enlarges the story and puts it into a whole new level. The excellent acting, and a great adapted screenplay makes this movie one of the greatest films ever in history. \n",

      "I was at the video store with my girlfriend and we wanted to rent out a few movies. I decided that one of the films we should rent out is 'The Shawshank Redemption'. I had always wondered why it had such good ratings as well as being positioned at #2 in the IMDb Top 250, and I thought I would see just how good the movie really was.When the film concluded in a way that I would have never conceded, I sat there in front of the TV surprised and dumbfounded. When my girlfriend asked me what was wrong, I simply just said \"That....is the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life.\" It was not just an ordinary and clichéd film I was watching, it was art on the screen, 2 and a half hours of extraordinary cinematography, unforgettable acting, and a plot so compelling, that you just did not want it to end. Morgan Freeman as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy are the perfect choices for their respective roles. The prison setting is so daunting and visually satisfying, while the corruption by the warden and the guards is dreadfully brutal yet extraordinarily eye popping. I normally dislike some movies that normally go for over 2 hours as I think they are just dragging on, but Shawshank along with very few others kept me glued to the screen in suspense. I hung onto every scene and every word uttered in the entire film.'The Shawshank Redemption' is unique in its own little way, and it has affirmed my belief that hope and courage through adversity is possible and rewarding. Not many movies are made like this, and I just hope that there is a movie like, but probably not as good as, 'The Shawshank Redemption' that will be made in this hostile and cruel 21st Century.

      "You'd certainly have to be over a certain age to watch this movie. Not because it contains small amounts of very realistic and believable violence (kids are used to that nowadays) but very much so because of the psychological impact it could have. Forget horror ... if I was a kid and had seen this movie it would completely alter my perception of humanity, given I would understand it. Once beyond that certain age this movie will impress you, to say the least.Shawshank Redemption places a man in the wrong place, at the wrong time (early 1900's) and in the worst kind of scenario. He's convicted of the murder of his wife and sentenced to life imprisonment. This is how the movie starts. From this point on the majority of the scenes will take place in the Shawshank Prison Facility.Logicly, as a viewer, you side for the Andy Dufresne (beautifly interpreted by Tim Robbins). It doesn't really matter whether you think he did it or not ... he's stuck in there and it looks like he'll be there for a while. Friendships are born and enemies are made, as you would expect. The way this movie maintains a thrilling storyline describing the friendships, however, is stunning. At the receiving end of one of those friendships is 'Red' Redding (Morgen Freeman), a fellow inmate. 'Red' can get you anything and as Andy, 'Red' is serving a life sentence. Let's just say they have the time to get to know each other, learn from each other and eventually save each other.Because of the limited scenery the story and acting performance gets all the attention it deserves. If I had to condense this movie into a few words, \"intelligence, justice, friendship, being human, redemption\" would all sound like understatements.

I am not obsessive, whenever it is on, I watch it.For most movies, at least the dramatic ones, I measure them based on how they make me feel.

However, none before and none since have been more overrated then The Shawshank Redemption.  While the Shawshank Redemption is not a waste of your viewing times by any means, it is not the pinnacle of film making.  The performances are good, especially Freeman, but I'm not too high on the way the plot works out.  It doesn't really break any new ground, a man is wrongfully convicted of a crime he didn't commit(Wow, that's new!!), and learns to cope with his new circumstances, while befriending the prison veterans.  While the audience learns a valuable lesson about the determination and courage of the human spirit!

When I see something like this rated in the top 10 films of the 1990s let alone of all time, I have to wonder about people's taste in general.  The message of the movie isn't incredibly powerful nor is the plot.  How can anyone consciously say this movie was the best ever?  It boggles my mind, but I have a few theories.  First this movie is recent enough and shown on TNT enough (like 5 times a month), that alot of people have seen it more then once.  Younger people (I'm talking teens and twenties), who haven't seen many Dramas let alone the real \"great\" movies, will say this is the best. If you ask this same demographic what is the best comedy of all time, they are likely to say something like Happy Gilmore (which Caddyshack blows out of the water for best golf comedy).  These are the kinds of people giving Shawshank it's highest praise, these people are sadly my generation. \n",

      "I shall be short with no spoilers about the movie.This is a superb picture. Everything is right, spot on right. Beautiful acting, good camera work and a soundtrack that really helps the movie to that extra level. It is a slow, but not too slow, unraveling story with some nice twists and turns in it, all with a good ending.Do not expect much comedy and quick action, but a good story.My recommendation: 10 out of 10 points \n",

      "Years ago I was browsing IMDb and looked at this film called Shawshank Redemption as the highest ranked film. I had to watch it. Everyone I asked around praised the film so I decided to finally sit down and watch. Every single aspect of this film shines, but here are some highlights.Andy's character arc is amazing. He is truly a troubled man, hanging on a single shred of hope to get by a horrible life in prison. Red is a man destined to be in prison, befriending Andy and haunting us in Morgan Freemans impeccable narration. Shawshank Prison is a haunting place, the film just absorbs us into it. We feel it, it feels terrible, eternal even. All this is joined by Thomas Newman's fantastic score (my favorite of his) and one of the most memorable main themes ever made. I had to re-watch this film to fully appreciate every detail. This film wastes no scene, no character. Everything works. And best of all, it's one of the most fulfilling and hopeful films you can watch. It has truly become my favorite film. It came to me in a time when I had lost a lot of hope, so you can consider this to be a personal film as well. Haven't seen it, yet? What are you waiting for?? \n",

      "This gem of a movie The Shawshank Redemption, ironically, was snubbed during its time (1994)---both critically and commercially. In recent years, however, there's a growing legion of cineastes singling out this film as the best, if not, one of the best of all time.This movie is the perfect example of a masterpiece way ahead of its time. Take it as Beethoven's Symphony #5 of cinema. Years go by and the echo of its message gets louder and becomes even more relevant. It's about how we are defined by the establishment's greed and corruption.It's about how we have forgotten our humanity.It's about why our possessions, especially money, continue to deny us of the ever-elusive happiness we all yearn for.It's about our capability to love our fellowmen under any circumstances.Most importantly, it's about life as a matter of choice and how we can outdo the fear that imprisons us in misery. If only we tap our power from within. As its main message suggests, \"Fear can hold us prisoner. Hope can set us free.\"The Shawshank Redemption is a must for those undergoing severe depression. It keeps us glued to our seats while all of its elements seem to magnify the message of hope, love AND yes...redemption.With a budget of $25 million, it earned only $58 million. It had 7 Oscar nominations but won nothing. NADA. It is underrated and over qualified.However, it has been #1 on IMDb's user-generated Top 250 since 2008, when it surpassed The Godfather. In my opinion, this is the best movie of all time. Morgan Freeman must be honoured with the best performance of all time.My criteria: unlike The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption does not only grip the viewer's heart.

He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a \"prison drama\" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word \"redemption\" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. \n",

      "I'm the 2436th person to review this movie. I first saw this movie on TV while at a girl's house I was dating. I came in at about 30 minutes into the movie but I was truly captivated by the movie and I never forgot it. More than 15 years later I saw it on DVD uncut and I liked it even more. Some things I'd forgotten about from the last time I had seen it. But one thing I will never forget is the brutality of that lead guard, played by Clancy Brown. This was a movie that wanted me to abolish maximum security prisons! The violence, the rape the intimidation the corruption! It didn't start with Attica (See My Review Of Against The Wall) but has been in existence since America's founding.Tim Robbin's character had the worst luck of anyone in the world! He was at the crime scene but did not go into the room where his wife was cheating on him. He left bullets behind and then stupidly threw his gone into the river only to not have it be discovered. Had he kept his gun the ballistics would have proved that his gun was not the murder weapon. As it stands another killer did the murder and in essence got away with the crime. This led to Andy's (Robbin's Character) being convicted for a crime he did not commit.I was amazed at the inner strength that Robbin's character Andy had. He was beaten, humiliated, raped and yet was able to still persevere without losing his mind. But that's what he had in abundance. He had a mind and he used it to outwit his enemies and friends too. In many ways his escape reminded me of the two fellows who escaped from prison a few months ago in New York. It was a tenacious desire to get one's freedom from the oppression of the Man! This is why I admired Tim Robbins and his character, Andy.Redd was portrayed so well by Morgan Freeman that the story might just as well have been about him too. I'm glad that Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford were not cast in these roles. The film would have suffered I'm sure. But I will say this, the film might have done better at the box office had the title been different. Shawshank Redemption is not really a catchy title and may have turned women and some men off entirely to seeing the film. This is what at least one writer said. Despite this I give the film Four and a Half Stars. Leonard Maltin gave it Two and a Half out of Four Stars. I disagree with that but he may have been turned off by the length of the film.The author Robert A. Berman in his fantastic book Fade In: The Screen writing Process said something interesting. He said that he had read an article about films with bad titles. He said that almost every badly titled film did poorly at the box office. \"The Shawshank Redemption, which did okay in theatres, might have done more business with a better title. I passed on seeing The Shawshank Redemption in the theatres. The title just turned me off.\" He went on to say that he saw it on Pay-For-View and liked it while adding that a good title can make a difference in box office sales. I concur with this observation. The title of this movie is nothing to write home about. This may have explained its average showing at the box office. Despite this, don't hold back from seeing this fine film. It's a true gem! \n",

It portrays the corruption going on within heavily guarded facilities (such as this one) in such a simple, yet brutal way - that despite the crime committed (with a few exceptions of course) it makes you question the justice system and its fairness.

      "The cast is superb. A real chemistry seems to bond Robbins, Freeman, and their inner circle. Will Sadler, the stone-faced bad guy in Die Hard 2, steals several scenes as the country-loving Heywood, and Vancouver native Gil Bellows shines as Tommy, the cocky high-school drop-out whose fate is pretty much sealed once we're told he has a wife and baby son waiting for him outside the prison walls. Brown, with his hair trimmed so neatly he's this close to being a dead ringer for Al Gore, displays an obsessive brutality that his Highlander role never hinted at. Freeman delivers a subtle but potent performance, letting just the teeniest dabs of despair leak through the cracks of his easy- going facade. Robbins brings the perfect mixture of fresh-faced bewilderment and canny deceit to his role as Dufresne, handling the dramatic and comic elements with equal ease. Watching these actors work together is a real treat, and they more than make up for the script's deficiencies. \n",

This movie has quite probably the best ending in movie history. An ending that has been built all the way throughout the entire movie without you even noticing. I have always thought this was the best movie ever made. When I discovered the IMDb website I was very excited to see that many people must agree with me.

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless classic that has consistently been ranked as one of the greatest movies of all time. The originality of the plot, well developed characters and engrossing story keeps you glued to your seat. Watching it for the first time, the initial slow pace of the movie may baffle you but it quickly transforms into a thrilling story that makes you wonder about how life can suddenly change. It was a new experience to learn about the North American prison system and the life within the walls of a correctional facility. While watching it for a second time I was engrossed by the subtle hints at every stage of the movie that built up to a spectacular ending. This is a story of injustice, friendship, bonding, struggle, patience, sorrow, happiness and ingenuity  a true emotional roller coaster that covers you with a generous splattering of brutal truth. It teaches us to never give up on life and the importance of a meticulous long term plan for success. The movie is set in a different time but even a new generation of film viewers can certainly relate to the universal concepts that have been so beautifully featured in this film. \n",

      "Frank Darabont's \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a good movie. It has a solid cast, a solid script, and solid cinematography. The film is at times engaging, moving and thrilling. You'd be hard-pressed to find anything particularly wrong with it.But that doesn't make it a great movie.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a very safe film. Not so much in terms of story, but in how it's executed. Frank Darabont directs the film competently, and seems content to stay at that level the whole time. Roger Deakins, possibly the best cinematographer working today, seems to be phoning it in, and the usually excellent Thomas Newman provides an unmemorable score. Everyone seems to be operating at three- quarters cylinder, enough to be good, but never enough to be amazing.This extends to most of the performances. Tim Robbins as the wrongfully convicted Andy Dufresne is not a particularly engaging lead. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are fun in antagonistic roles, but they've both given much better performances. The ensemble cast of prisoners is game, but very few of them are given much to do.The standout performance is easily Morgan Freeman's Red, who helps Andy navigate life in Shawshank State Penitentiary, and that has more to do with Morgan Freeman being Morgan Freeman than it does anything to do with the role.There is little wrong with \"The Shawshank Redemption\". But it takes more than having nothing wrong to make a great film. A great film requires risky decisions, new ideas or masters of their craft bringing their A-game. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has none of these, and that's not a bad thing. It's a decent film. Just not a masterpiece. \n",

The director Frank Darabont has been flawless with his work. The story is about Andy Dufrane (played by Tim Robbings through the eyes of Red (played by Morgan Freeman, in his best role ever).

I remember that desire being surprisingly powerful, despite understanding that I had enjoyed it as much as I did while watching it. Its power surprised me because I didn't understand fully how or why I felt the way I did. On subsequent viewings, I prepared myself for the ending, for THAT feeling, which I began to examine. I would describe it as something on par with the end of a relationship, if not perfectly in scale, then certainly in context. A good relationship. One that ends too early, but does so because it must, because that is just how it is sometimes. I am always struck with a deep yearning to see more, to know and feel more, but also a comfort. That even though I didn't get everything I wanted, what I got is a damn sight good enough, and I should be grateful for that. But it aches, too. And then you realize that it's over, and you're going to wake up tomorrow, and start living your life again. But now you'll live having gone through this, with this perspective, this story in your memory. It's small, not actually the same experience, but it's close. The same shape and color. No other film, no story, gives me this feeling. And just like in relationships, sometimes I end up watching nothing but disappointing titles, I have a moment when I ask myself why I do it. That maybe I'm wasting my time. And then I remember. And then I hope. \n",

But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen.

I brake every single time when watching sequence when Brooks gets out of prison and the whole sequence of living free - it is a powerful film making so say the least.Overall, No.1 at IMDb Top 250 says a lot - this is a movie that stays with you and inspires you not to lose hope. It is flawlessly paced - at running time 2 h 20 min it never drags - it should be studied at film making universities HOW to create a film with no women characters, when action takes place inside the prison and there isn't mainstream action at all.

      "\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not.

Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a \"prison drama\" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word \"redemption\" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. \n",

When Andy comes across inmate Red, the two form a near two decade long relationship. With Tim Robbins and Morgen Freeman in lead roles, Shawshank is an absolute masterpiece that every film lover should watch. Frank Darabont's directing is great and even more so than any of his previous work. There's really not much wrong with Shawshank. The adaptation from Stephen Kings epic novel is compelling, exciting, disheartening and inspiring. With great supporting characters, an incredible plot and stunning directing, Shawshank has become one of the greatest movies ever made. Its an absolute travesty that this didn't win the Oscar for Best Picture in 1994 although there was some stiff competition. \n",

      "There are very few films that can simply blow a human being's mind away but boy; Shawshank redemption does one hell of a job. From the very get go, Shawshank will have you on the edge of your seats.Tim Robbins, a man whose career was on an initial down hill slide with flops such as Howard The Duck redeemed himself and then some with his portrayal of a man who looses everything in a second and then spends 20 years trying to get it all back. Robbins gave a calm misdemeanor to his character, which always gave the impression that he had something planned, that we were not expecting. Morgan Freeman gives, in my opinion the best performance of his distinguishable career. He maintains a streetwise wisdom and this, too me, makes him the \"go to guy\" of the prison. His calm yet intelligent nature is kept through out the film and does not seem affected by Andy but after the escape, Freeman does superbly in showing the contrast in the streetwise dealer of the prison to a man who misses his friend. Thomas Newman's compelling score sets a dark and ominous tone and does what many scores don't; it reflects the thought of the characters as opposed to the tone of the scene. Darabont created a diverse prison world from the street smart ones, to the homesick ones to the rapists but I was not a fan of how racism was sidestepped in the movie. If I had one nit pick, and this is scraping the bottom of the barrel; I would have expected a few racial slurs directed at some of the prisoners, particularly Red. It would have been true of the time but then again its not the point of the story.Ultimately, Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece and has a powerful yet happy enough ending to touch the heart of anybody. \n",

      "Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free  These words inscribed on the poster of The Shawshank Redemption sum up what's at stake in Frank Darabont's chef-d'oeuvre. The Shawshank Redemption shows us that there is hope even within the restricted walls of a prison.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)is a prominent banker wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her paramour, who spends many years in the Shawshank prison. He forges an unforgettable friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), a veteran of the penal system, who helps him to cope with the frightening realities of prison life. While the prison walls shield Red and the other prisoners from the depredations of an ever-changing world, it has the exact opposite effect on Dufresne, who exploits every possible opportunity to bring a taste of the outside world to himself and his fellow convicts. Their bond forms the backbone of the film.Tim Robbins is right at the top of his game as he paints a fascinating portrait of an unjustly incarcerated inmate and brings an innate humanity to Stephen King's principal character. Freeman is exceptional as Red and his narrative much of which is taken verbatim from King's story, holds the story together and like a skilled conductor, waves a baton to orchestrate our emotions.Frank Darabont uses his powers as a supreme storyteller and an astonishing craftsman to breathe life into a genre that I thought had been dead since The Great Escape. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, masterfully told. The film's greatest triumph is its earnestness that makes even those moments that might have felt slushy, achieve the dignity of genuine tragedy. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope that can reduce the most hardened into misty-eyed wonderment.The Shawshank Redemption warrants repeated viewing! \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances. Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing.A passing reference to 'The Count of Monte Cristo' offers a partial clue to what makes this movie compelling.Top-notch performances, exceptional cinematography, and masterful direction combine to make this film something special indeed.I love this film. It's a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue.http://www.quantumvisionsystempdf.com \n",

      "There's nothing in life more meaningful than endlessly talking about movies, and there's no discussion as entertaining as fighting over which was the best year for films. I always go for 1994, mainly because it produced three movies that are truly unique and show up in every best of list you can imagine. I mean, it's pretty tough to find a person that doesn't have either \"Forrest Gump\", \"Pulp Fiction\" or \"The Shawshank Redemption\" in their personal top ten. While the first two movies still have a considerable group of opponents (to some people \"Forrest Gump\" is too much of a tearjerker, while \"Pulp Fiction\" apparently glorifies violence too much), \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is one of those movies nobody can really dislike. It's a movie that goes beyond matters of taste, the story, writing and acting are so undeniably good that it's tough to come up with a counterargument. Writer/director Frank Darabont is also a fantastic dialogue writer, particularly when it comes to bit characters. You can also see this in the somewhat inferior \"The Green Mile\", characters who only have one or two lines say the perfect line on the perfect moment. The amazing performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do the rest. The best movie ever made? It's definitely up there. \n",

      "Often said to be one of the best films of all time, I can't help but agree. No matter how many times I watch this over, I feel like it never bores me and I am always captivated in a way that I've never felt with any other film before.The Shawshank Redemption is a tale of hope, courage and betrayal, seen through the eyes of prison inmates 'Andy' played by Tim Robbins, and older convict 'Red', portrayed by Morgan Freeman in an Oscar nominated performance. The film is set over 19 years in Shawshank prison, and depicts the life of Andy Dufresne, a hotshot banker and his struggle with keeping his mind and his sanity, whilst serving time for a crime he didn't commit. As Andy has to put up with harassment, distress and affliction throughout the duration of his time at the prison, the film illustrates a tale of eternal hope. As time slowly passes in the prison, he's assisted by an older inmate by the name of 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman), a black marketer who is 'known to locate certain things from time to time'. As the years pass by, Andy's friendship with Red grows and so do the hardships they have to overcome.The film itself has touched me in many ways, it shows me just what people can do when they have a little faith and keep incessant hope no matter what. Obviously, Stephen King's greatest and most memorable big screen interpretation, one of which he is almost certainly proud of. The movie is a timeless classic that speaks to me and probably a lot of others on so many levels, providing a near perfect film with a great plot line and representing a storyline with an even better message.Tim Robbins delivers an enthralling performance as the titular character, one that certainly stands out throughout the film whereas Morgan Freeman's interpretation of fellow convict Red is just as captivating, earning him recognition from the academy but not his fellow co-star Robbins, obviously yet another Oscar snub.Overall, the Shawshank Redemption speaks out to its audience, as it shows a tale of perseverance and perpetual hope when in the midst of the struggles in life. The film itself is possibly my favourite of all time and manages to keep my attention on the 10th time of watching it. A must-see for anyone who has a good taste in films and is looking for a movie that will change their perspective on life and give them the hope to pull through in the darkest of times. \n",

      "I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.

      "This is the best movie ever but I give you 15 Things You May Not Have Known About The Shawshank Redemption1. It's Based on a Novella by Stephen King The film is based on Stephen King's novella \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,\" which was published in a short story collection called Different Seasons. Two of the other short stories in the collection were made into films, Stand By Me in 1986 and Apt Pupil in 1998. Only one of them, \"The Breathing Method,\" has not been turned into a movie.2. It's Similar to Tolstoy King's novella shares several plot points with a nine-page short story by Russian writer Leo Tolstoy called \"God Sees the Truth, But Waits.\" Both are about men sent to prison for murders they didn't commit.3. Director Frank Darabont Got a Good Deal on the Rights to King's Story He bought the rights from King for $1.4. It Almost Had a Much Different Cast Castle Rock Entertainment, the studio that made Shawshank, was co-founded by Rob Reinerdirector of another King adaptation, Stand By Meand is named after the mythical Maine town that provides the setting for many of King's books. After director Frank Darabont pitched Shawshank to the studio, Reiner originally offered $2.5 million for the script to star Tom Cruise as Andy Dufresne and Harrison Ford as Red.5. The Original Title Was Changed to Avoid Confusion Darabont wrote the script in eight weeks before pitching it to Castle Rock Entertainment. He decided to drop the \"Rita Hayworth\" part of the novella because actresses sent their resumes in for consideration thinking it was a Rita Hayworth biopic. During the casting process, Darabont even received a call from an agent who represented a supermodel; he swore the script was the best she had ever read and that she'd be perfect for the (non-existent) part of Hayworth.6. It Was Filmed in Ohio Although the film is set in Maine, the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio stood in for Shawshank Prison. The structure was slated to be torn down, but the production delayed the demolition for a year. After the film wrapped, all the buildings in the complex were torn down except the cell block and main administrative building, which were preserved for historical purposes.7. Morgan Freeman Got Really Good at Catch The scene where Andy first approaches Red about the rock hammer as Red plays catch in the main yard took nine hours to shoot. Freeman continued to play catch for the whole nine hours without complaining and showed up the next day with his arm in a sling.8. The Film Was Inspired by Goodfellas Darabont says his main source of inspiration was Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas because of its use of voice-over narration and editing techniques.9. Voiceovers Are Tricky Business Originally, all of Morgan Freeman's voice-over was recorded before any of the film was shot. The fact that much of it syncs up to the on screen action (see: the scene on the roof where the inmates drink beer) isn't simple editing. Darabont would playback the recorded voice-over on-set during each take for the actors to specifically play off of the audio. But the audio quality of his voice-over was too poor to include in the movie due to tape hiss, so Freeman had to re-record the entire voice-over in post-production.10. They Got Lucky with One of the Most Famous Scenes Every take of the film's signature shot of Tim Robbins raising his arms outstretched in the rain after Andy breaks out of prison was out of focus except the one in the film. It was the final take shot for that scene.11. The Prop Guy Was a Jokester The visual joke of Andy's rock hammer being tucked into the Bible right after the first page of the Book of Exodus came from the film's prop master Tom Shaw.12. None of the Close-up Shots of Andy's Hands or Feet are Tim Robbins They're director Frank Darabont.13. Stephen King's Red Was Changed for the Film In the original novella, Red is described as a middle-aged Irishman.14. The Mug Shot of Young Red Isn't Morgan Freeman It's actually a photo of his son.15. The Tree Where Red Finds Andy's letter Isn't in Fort Hancock, Texas It's in Ohio's Malabar Farm State Park. \n",

A tale of two jail inmates/friends, The Shawshank Redemption shines a light on the injustice of this world and the pleasures of freedom after years of confinement. It proves that through all the troubling experiences, one man never loses sight of his dream.

      "This movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goof ball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967. Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form. The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wise guy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle. If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word. \n",

      "Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).Director Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.If there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable. \n",

      "Talk about your school of hard knocks. In The Shawshank Redemption (Columbia, R), Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a tall, soft-spoken New England banker, is convicted-wrong- ly-of killing his adulterous wife and her lover. It's 1947, and Andy, having received a double life sentence, is shipped off to Shawshank State Prison in Maine, a maximum-security fortress packed to the grimy gills with thieves, rapists, and murderers. How bad is life at Shawshank? So bad that when Andy trudges off the bus along with a dozen other new inmates, the veteran prisoners make wagers on who'll be the first to cry. So bad that Andy finds a huge, wriggly yellow maggot buried in his lunch. So bad that, over the next two years, he is systematically beaten and raped by the Sisters, a crew of leering renegade inmates who take special delight in tormenting their fellow prisoners. Make no mistake: Andy gets worked over-and so does the audience.But then, good things have a way of happening to unfortunate movie characters. Early in his stay, Andy makes the acquaintance of Red (Morgan Freeman), a sly survivor who is serving a life sentence for murder and who acts as Shawshank's one-man black market, smuggling the prisoners anything they want-cigarettes, reefer, cards with naked ladies (''I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck,'' he deadpans). As soon as Andy bonds with Red, things start to ! look up. He gets hold of a rock hammer so that he can sculpt an elegant chess set. He does the guards' tax returns in exchange for perks like beer on a sunbaked afternoon. He expands the dusty, neglected book room into the most comprehensive prison library in New England. Set over a period of 20 years (the passing decades are marked by Andy's pinup posters of Rita Hayworth, then Marilyn, then Raquel), The Shawshank Redemption begins as a nightmare, a postwar- New England Midnight Express, but it doesn't take long to reveal its true, feel-good colors. The movie is about survival, triumph, and a thing called hope. It's about a hero who rises above the squalor because he's blessed-a saint in the muck. It's Midnight Express Goes Gump.You need a certain craftsmanship to traffic in twin brands of manipulation- the exploitative and the sentimental-and there's no denying that Frank Darabont, who wrote and directed The Shawshank Redemption (it's based on a short novel by Stephen King), knows just what he's doing. The moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality; you feel as if you could reach out and touch the prison walls. And Darabont is an accomplished button pusher. He coaches the actors so that you always know exactly who to root for and against. When it comes to a character like the warden (Bob Gunton), all Bible- thumping righteousness, the movie has no compunction about turning up the hissability factor. He starts out mean, then turns meaner, then meaner still. When Andy blasts Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro over loudspeakers to the prison work field, it becomes a full-scale opera-soothes-the-savage-breast number, with the prisoners standing open-mouthed at the sublime sounds. The scene is meant to fire our righteous liberal hearts. It helps, of course, that most of the prisoners don't actually behave like criminals. They never say a word about their pasts-even Andy remains a downtrodden cipher-and this lends the proceedings a hollow, generic feel, as if Darabont had constructed a blueprint out of old prison melodramas.A movie like The Shawshank Redemption, with its brazenly mechanical plotting and its wish-fulfillment finale, requires a lead actor who can carry us on the wings of his good spirits. Tim Robbins is crafty and likable when Andy is hoodwinking the guards, and he makes you feel the character's mute anguish. Yet in shouldering what is essentially a laconic- good-guy, neo-Gary Cooper role, Robbins never quite makes emotional contact with the audience. His face, foggy and placid, suggests an overgrown baby's; there's something naggingly unformed about him. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, with his delicate smolder, his eyes that seem to peer directly into everyone's soul, makes Red feel genuine, lived-in. Speaking of the prison walls, he says, ''First you hate 'em. Then you get used to 'em.After long enough, you get so you depend on 'em. That's institutionalized.'' With his gift for rapt pauses, for caressing just the right syllable, Freeman can make a speech like that sound like one of the philosophical nuggets of the ages. Then again, isn't it time Morgan Freeman stopped playing the soulful sidekick? While we're on the subject of prison walls, an actor as great as he is shouldn't get too used to movies like this one.

This truly is my favorite movie of all-time, because no matter how many times I see it, I still get the genuine feeling of hope the film has delivered since the first time I saw it. Everything about this movie is perfect; from the cinematography, to the acting, the casting, the writing...everything. It's a fantastic example of the power of hope and the true nature of the human spirit. When you watch it, you just know that every scene is classic; so many moments will be remembered forever in film history. If anything, it just keep getting better with each time I see it.

The Shawshank Redemption works not only as an excellent prison drama, but as a metaphor for overcoming our own private prisons.An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!

      "In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the \"bull queer\" gang \"the Sisters\" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston).In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library.In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias \"Randall Stephens\".In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package.The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited. \n",

      "Without doubt one of the most endearing stories to touch the human soul. Very rare a film succeeds in taking the mantle away from the novel. However this is one of those cases when it simply just does.This soul finding, awe inspiring against all the odds film is a great adaptation of Stephen King's 1982 Novella entitled 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'.This is the film that will make you think that there is hope in the world and that with great perseverance 'anything can be over come'. Set in the times of what looks like the depression and located within the backdrop of the sleepy south of America.A man sent to prison for life for a crime he did not commit, and how this alien world of the lower reaches of society seem at first that he will be broken and beaten and either die or go mad (as so many of the inmates succumb to). As Simon and Garfunkel had their books and poetry 'to protect them (me)' so the lead character Andy Dufresne has his to protect him from such failings. In Rita Hayworth he has a passage of physical escape as opposed to the virtual world of books. He gains respect over time not through physical violence but by the craft of his mind and sheer willpower. Like a chess master he is thinking several moves ahead of everyone. Even the old master lag played by Morgan Freeman can only watch this man from a distance. However he relays through mainly past tense commentary how this man was as GB Shaw would say was 'Superman'. Eventually like a great master he exposes the lies,hypocrisy and greed of the evil church going warden. This is not a film but a journey to the very survival of the human soul and as the lead character passes through leads a golden light on those condemned even if only for a passing moment in time. Like a bird on a journey he is destined to be free. Enjoy this film because it may if only for a moment save your soul. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances.The screenplay was written by Frank Darabont, who based it on the novella \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\" by Stephen King. He adapts the material so well that he really transcends it, turning the film into a work of art. Many avid readers will claim the book is always better than the movie, but that is simply not the case here. King is a tremendous writer, but even he can't shade and color the prison the way that Darabont does, which sets the mood for the entire film. The characters King created in the book are deeper and more well drawn in the film in large part because of Darabont's script. Many moviegoers turn their noses up at the thought of a movie about the triumph of the human spirit. However, even those jaded film fans will love \"The Shawshank Redemption\" because it sets a new standard for films in this genre. It is an unapologetically emotional and sometimes sentimental take on friendship and life, even when that life is spent in a cage, and will make viewers laugh, cry, and reflect on their own lives in ways that very few movies can. It may not have won a single Oscar, but it will win your heart, and perhaps that is more important. \n",

The movie omits most of the stuff so you do the work, including the emotional work, and that I value greatly in a movie. Movies that make you feel and think, that are not obvious and bogus are the ones you should watch. Directors that don't tell you in each scene exactly the actors are feeling and thinking... no. You need adventures through each history, through realms of thought. Those are the ones you should watch. I don't want to go deep in the movie to avoid spoilers, since I write reviews for guys to decide if they are going to watch. So here is the tip: If you are looking for fun this might not be you guy. You will cry and I don't like that when movie syncing with friends.

      "One of the masterpieces of Stephen King that became another memorable masterpiece for movies (and one of the most underrated films by the Academy).\"Shawshank Redemption\" is one of the most magnificent and beautiful films ever made, is not the first time that another work of Stephen King becomes a must see classic. Thanks to Frank Darabont, the film became unforgettable and also thanks to the magnificent history. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a simple and shy bank worker, who after seeing his wife with her lover, he threats to kill her. His wife and her lover show up dead in the next day and Andy is sentenced to life imprisonment in Shawshank institute where begins his great life story when he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and a strong friendship starts between this two during the long years of imprisonment. Andy manages to bring many benefits to the prison and the prisoners, but only later that Andy discovers that his arrest was all a \"misunderstanding.\"The strongest points of the film is the screenplay of Darabont writing and detailing the film with greater mastery possible by putting us in the place of Andy and get us feeling the tightness and claustrophobia of prison. But at the same time with a very well-constructed dialog that narrates the film without blemish and without leaving any loose end, leaving the story and his final message in greater perfection. A story that teaches the value of friendship and strong at the same time of hope, one of the beautiful things in life and that we can never abandon it or forget it.Not only the story is absolutely amazing and without any flaws, but the performances of each of the cast stand out, Morgan Freeman being perfect as in all his roles. But who stands out is definitely Tim Robbins with a show of perfection while maintaining its character as it is, shy and who keeps to himself and does not try to be anything more than that.A film that is undoubtedly magnificent, a true masterpiece that should be watched over and over again to witness this spectacle emotionally breathtaking classic. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a phenomenal movie with a very well developed storyline, outstanding character development and a fantastic cast. It's almost immediately engaging, I found myself engrossed by the story from the very first scene, as we follow Andy Dufresne in his journey in to prison, we feel the characters emotions, even without them being properly exposed and as the film progresses we see him form relationships in Shawshank prison that add a lot of depth. The character development in this movie is ridiculously well written and is what writers should look towards as inspiration, the relationship between Andy and Red, Brooks' entire story arch, the Warden and Captain's partnership, it's all very believable, as well as captivating thanks to a terrific script by Frank Darabont. The performances are all absolutely outstanding, Tim Robbins emotional, enclosed personality as Andy is terrific, Bob Gunton's sinister delivery, Clancy Brown's threatening persona, James Whitmore's innocent, uneducated attitude, it all comes together to create engaging, realistic people. However, the undeniable star of the show, and the main reason this film is #1 on IMDb's Top 250 has to be Morgan Freeman, his portrayal of Red is immediately enticing, he's a pure, honest man who keeps the story moving with narration, Freeman's voice-over work for this film adds that extra layer that was very necessary and added so much more power, his dialogue with Robbins is some of the best acting I have ever seen, and the moment in which he speaks about his parole for the final time is possibly the highlight of this amazing actors entire career. Very engaging, emotional, The Shawshank Redemption is a long movie, but I never found myself wanting it to end, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama.

When I finally decided to see it, I immediately regretted not watching it any sooner. The film is heartbreaking and frustrating from the start, but in the end, you would truly feel redemption. You could feel the pain and injustice brought upon Andy, the protagonist. As I watched the movie, I felt as if I was in prison with him; I felt as if I've gone through the struggles that he went through as well. You could see how time is irrelevant in prison; you feel minutes go by when it's actually days, weeks, months, and years. And then you'll feel disappointed at all those years where you could have done something different in the world outside.The film is also an eye-opener. You open your eyes to what its like in prison; although, the prison in the movie seems more ideal than real life prisons. You get a glimpse of brutality and rape inside prison. You get to see how some prisoners become institutionalized and never seem to want to leave anymore. There is also a depiction of how rampant corruption is, and its sad to think that those involved are the ones who are supposed to be protecting and abiding by the law.The cast is great. I couldn't ask more from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Even the other prisoners are good too. Overall, I think that the main point of this movie is never to lose hope; that hope is always a good thing. This movie is as equally good as Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction (movies that were made in the same year as this), but I can't understand why only these two movies got most of the attention.

The acting is incredible and Freeman and Robbins deliver the performances of their career, the script is incredible (another great collaboration between Steven King and Frank Darabont) and it didn't win one single Oscar! This could have been good enough for three Oscars at the least, true, the competition (Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction) were good films but, The Shawshank was certainly good enough to win a couple.So if you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption, buy it, rent it and watch one of the most powerful and moving films ever, be prepared to be blown away. \n",

The acting is first class. The cinematography is first class. The sound is first class. The casting is first class. The dialogue is fantastic. All these elements and more make this a riveting watch and you end up wishing the film could be longer.This is one of the few times i've seen a film after reading the book thinking the film is an improvement.

      "Shawshank Redemption narrates a beautiful story of two prisoners bonding over the number of years. Their experiences in the prison and the chemistry between two (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) have been shot with terrific care.Editing and Screenplay of this movie are among the best in any movie you will see.

      "\"Every mind has billions of ideas and each one of us do things that no one expects us to do, some of those things are visible, some not",
      " but one of those things that make our life worth living is FREEDOM\"Tim Robbins stars as Andy Dufresne, a young man who faces a long, long time in prison after he is wrongfully found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover. While inside he learns an awful lot about what a man can hold onto and let himself be put through if there is still an ounce of hope in his soul. Bottles of cool drink on a hot rooftop, a slowly building library collection, the moment of musical joy that sees Dufresne severely punished for his overstepping of the mark and many other scenes spring to mind as classic moments in a movie almost chock full of classic moments. Andy quickly gets befriended by \"Red\" (Morgan Freeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances, within the \"hell on earth\" they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom... Morgan Freeman is the film's secret strength, playing \"the guy who can get it for you\" with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat, new convict (fresh fish) is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldn't break before Dufresne James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant ultimate doom, making the scene one of my all-time favorite displaying the ultimate dark side and a certain fear in freedom. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman along with James Whitmore etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with crime. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown. An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have tied with the winner, the equally good \"Forrest Gump.\"My Rating - 10/10 \n",

This is a movie that from start to finish keeps you engaged like no other film. When it concludes you wonder how a 2 hour plus movie can go by so quickly. No bathroom breaks or snack breaks during this movie, whether it's the first time watching it, or your tenth. Just sat down and watched it again 2 nights ago with my daughter (12).

I's indeed very overwhelmed & enthusiastic about the movie.(you know, that much publicity takes the excitement to the extreme level) Now, talking about the movie, it is a story of a man who gets life imprisonment sentence for a crime which he didn't commit. Here it remembers me about the classical Russian novella named 'The Kreutzer Sonata' by \"Leo Tolstoy\". It seems to me a bit inspired from that. Indeed. The rest of the story line is different. It specifically a story of a man's struggle (in which he got succeed) to come out of the prison (by hook or crook, take it your own way) and proved himself innocent after the hard sufferings of 19 years imprisonment. The whole story tells about the moral to heed i.e. \"Hopes Never Die.\" I really can keep this movie on my All-time favorite movies list. It deserves so, Btw. This is some of among those movies in which I didn't check the duration even a single time. And, during the whole movie I was just sitting on the edge of my chair with wide open my eyes & my mind (off course). And, for now, with classiness of this movie in my brains & off course terrible sleep in my eyes, I'm no more in situation to write anything else. But one thing I'd make sure that very soon I'm gonna read 'Stephen King'. And, At the last I'd like to halt my review by one of the dialogues of the movie, Which I liked a lot, \"Get busy living or get busy dying.\" And, I'm really nowhere an obtuse to just review it like a blind-head Ass.

The direction and screenplay by Frank Darabont and the fact that it is based upon \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" by Stephen King makes it highly likable. Moving on to the performances by Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, they shine just like a diamond, stupendous performances by them.

      "The greatness of this film is in its excellent presentation and articulation of what lies deep within a human being that makes him/her persevere against impossible odds, especially so when he/she is facing a terrible injustice. This reminds me of Viktor Frankl's book 'Man's Search for Meaning' based on his experiences in prison under far worse conditions than depicted in this film. It is only under the harshest and most extreme of circumstances that a sensitive and just human being whose integrity is under attack will almost certainly face the question of the meaning of his/her life and in general the meaning of life and the meaning of freedom. The only real freedom that human beings have lies in a creative response to the impossible but challenging circumstances that one faces, and in that creative expression one finds meaning. No one can give that freedom and no one can take away that freedom  its source is within, and completely independent of external circumstances and institutions. All institutions tend to inhibit this freedom and instead 'confine' individuals so that they become 'institutionalized'. The prison is the toughest of all institutions. But the tougher the conditions, the greater is the challenge and if understood that way, the greater the rewards in finding meaning. But until that is accomplished, one must have something essential and substantial to believe in  call it hope or faith or self esteem  in order to survive, for nothing is accomplished in death. At the same time, the idea of death itself is the motivating force  a sense that one could die without having achieved anything in life is the most powerful life sustaining force itself  this is the most stupendous paradox of human existence, something that was hinted at in Joseph Heller's Catch 22. At the centre of this catch is the hope (a word much abused) that one will find meaning even in the most hopeless of conditions, that one will be able to forge something good out of the entire BS that surrounds us. And that which is good lasts forever. That is the true faith, not the false faith of the corrupt Warden, who in this case is not only the proverbial 'devil who is fond of quoting from the scriptures' but also gives the airs and appearances of one who is a 'man of God' only because of his fanatical devotion to the Bible. The irony of it all is brought out superbly near the end. The ending was the best part in a way because this story was no hopelessly fated 'Greek Tragedy', as the central message of the film was that hope within one man can light up the hope in another who otherwise would have given up, and that this evocation is a very powerful bond between humans, in this case between two very different kind of humans, both by background as well as race, but who become the best of friends because they share something vital deep inside that makes them 'to get busy living' rather than to 'get busy dying'. Finally, what makes this one of the greatest movies is that it also has drama, adventure and action which makes it appealing to a wide audience. For the serious, it can revisited several times for the special kind of mood that it evokes  a mood that is both uplifting as well as thought provoking. \n",

Direction, screenplay and acting all are mind-boggling. Equally mind-boggling is how can this movie not get an Oscar even after considering that jury at Academy awards makes huge mistakes sometimes(remember \"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\"). In my mind I've no doubt that even if \"Avatar\", \"Titanic\", \"Return of the King\" and \"Ben Hur\" were all released in same year as this movie, the Oscars for best film, best direction, best actor and best supporting actor should all go to this movie. I've become a huge fan of Tim Robbins (he is brilliant in \"The Mystic River\" too) and Morgan Freeman. Also, let's not classify it as a prison movie since it's in a class of its own.

      "Awesome movie, Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's (Tim Robbins) trial inter cut with his actions on the night of his crime.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King's short story \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" (in the film version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole. However, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three- dimensional characterizations. \n",

Morgan Freeman gave a stellar performance, arguably his best also, as Red, Andy's cell mate another character you grow to love during this wonderful piece of cinema. This is a film i will never tire of, if you haven't watched it for whatever reason, you should do! A solid 10/10 for me! enjoy. \n",

      "This movie was released when I was all of 9 years old. Lucky for me, I didn't come across it until nearly 13 years after the fact. I have always been a movie buff and, aside from that, a big fan of the writings of Stephen King. I had read the short story the film is based on and it led me to this film, which I was certainly aware of prior but never checked out. Afterwards, I had a new list of benchmarks for certain aspects of cinema.First and foremost was the story itself. The writing of this tale, in screenplay form, is absolutely brilliant. The story is fleshed out without lingering in certain areas it would have been easy to linger in, and the pacing of the film is steady and constantly building emotional atmosphere. From the early feelings of confusion and bitter justice (as our main character is judged by his peers) to the dawning realization of what Shawshank Penitentiary has to offer for it's masses of convicted felons. It all flows fabulously, as the tale unwinds from the darkest despair of prison life into the slowly building and palpable hope Andy and Red seem to cultivate for the rest of the prisoners. It's this humanity in the face of inhumane conditions that is at the forefront of The Shawshank Redemption's impact.Second, but just as vital, was the casting. Tim Robbins has always been, in my mind, a criminally underrated acting talent. He always seems to carry a sense of outward vulnerability that belies an inner strength, and in that conflict one always questions his motivation, his reason for doing things. His skill set was married perfectly to the character of Andy Dufrense, who instantly seems in mortal danger within the walls of Shawshank but eventually rises above the concrete and steel. Indeed, it's safe to say that, mentally at least, Andy spent very little time in that prison.Morgan Freeman played the role of Red Redding in a manner that, I think, no other actor could have done. He was not only a veteran of Shawshank, he radiated a sense of calm wisdom and strong sense of brotherhood amongst his fellow inmates that lend themselves very well to Freeman's on-stage abilities. As a \"man who can get things\", Red is instrumental in many inmates' lives in Shawshank. Offering a variety of contraband items in return for the typical currency of incarcerated peoples (cigarettes, petty cash), Red is as important a character as Andy in terms of the film's overall message of hope despite hopelessness. And Morgan Freeman was the best man for that job.The excellent acting doesn't end there. Bob Gunton, who seems to find a niche in playing white-collar criminal types, portrays the warden of Shawshank as a sinister, scheming man who hides his darker desires behind the Bible and an arrogant, holier-than-thou attitude. William Sadler is another outstanding character actor, similar to Gunton, whose face is more popular than his name and who does a fine job as Heywood. One of the more important supporting roles was that of the hard right hand of the warden, Guard Officer Hadley, who was portrayed by Clancy Brown, well known for his bad-ass-type roles. His no-nonsense, hard-edged persona fits well and leaves you hating his character but appreciating his ability to make you hate someone who doesn't exist.Beyond the writing and the acting, this movie was perfect in every other aspect. I've seen it many times over the years, often turning to it, perhaps subconsciously, during particularly rough or depressing patches. I've very rarely come across a film that not only meets my expectations, but exceeds them in a way that leaves me constantly comparing future films to it. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films, where the outstanding story and the remarkable talents of everyone involved combine to bring vivid fiction to life. A masterpiece of modern film-making that has lost none of it's impact or relativity nearly 20 years later. \n",

A story of a life behind bars with no end, this ordinary man turns Shawshank prison up side down. I think the fact that this movie is so simple is also the reason it is so great. There is no complicated cinematic techniques or special effects, just men talking to each other. Tim Robbins shows us that the good guys can win even when their livelihood has been taken away. Its the kind of movie that just makes you smile on the inside and lets you appreciate the simple things even if just for that day.

      "Shawshank redemption is probably one of the greatest movies out there hands down. Its a story about a banker named Andy Dufresne who is sentenced to life in prison for killing his wife and her secret lover.At first for Andy it seems that life has taken a toll for the worst while he goes through the first initial weeks in Shawshank.Fortunately he befriends a group of the inmates over the course of his time there. Mainly a character named Red who has some push on things that go down in the prison. Red and Andy learn a lot of lessons from each other and become really great friends over their course of time at Shawshank. The dialogue in this movie is not only enticing, but also has a bit of comic relief here and there. To me this movie mainly revolves not only the character development of Andy as a man sent to jail for life, but mainly about the human condition and what it is like to no longer be a free man. Andy's' most important lesson that he learns in Shawshank is that while they can take virtually everything away from you including your pride and your dignity, they can never take your Hope. \n",

You will understand what redemption is, you will understand what a Fountain of Hope can do, if we let it reign inside of us.From the production, to the timing, to the script, and the acting of each character, The Shawshank Redemption gave justice to its box-office title.

      "Let me start out by saying that this is one of my personal all time favorites and as such I may be a bit bias whole reviewing it. On the other hand, there's a reason it's a personal favorite. The movie revolves around the wrongly imprisonment of Andy Dufrane (played by Tim Robbins) for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's life in prison, relationships with other inmates (particularly with \"Red\" played perfectly by Morgan Freeman) and passion for life and freedom. I recently had an argument with one of them regarding this movie. He claimed it was \"too plain\" to be considered so great; my view was (and is) that it maybe be plain, but it's superb. The movie touched me when I saw it, Brooks' long life in prison (amazing acting by James Whitmore), Red's pragmatic persona and Andy's unyielding will and hope, all combines to an amazing movie.In my opinion this isn't some regular \"feel good movie\", it's much more. It may be plain as my friend said, low on visual effects or outstanding camera work  but it's plainly superb. The texts send shivers down your spine, Frank Darabont's screenplay adaption to Stephan King's short story are brilliantly executed by the amazing cast and in the end that's what really matters.I was moved when the movie ended, viewed it and prison differently, I expect it'll remain as a cult favorite despite the \"no impressive effects and mediocre camera work\" as my friend put it.Go watch it if you haven't already, it's in my opinion one of the best movies of all time. \n",

      "I Watched the movie 16 years after its release. I must admit that i watched it out Of curiosity for its being on the top of the IMDb list. I wasn't disappointed. Rather felt a sense of victory. It doesn't have any action sequences or any romance or Anything of the sort. But it is one of those films that makes you feel Happy inside and yet sad that you may live many more years and watch Tons of movies but never feel the same climax or emotion that you get Out of this movie. This movie had the most powerful cast and amazing script, and all based on an awesome prison drama novel by horror-master Stephen King!Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in 1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover. Over the next 19 years, he does what he can to stay above the mire, consisting not only of the cruelty of his fellow inmates but the heavy hand of a brutal warden, Norton (Bob Gunton), a sadist who thumps his Bible while telling his charges that \"salvation lies within.\" Andy's stubborn refusal to give up hope in the face of his incarceration engenders the wonder and friendship of several inmates, especially \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who nevertheless wonders about Andy's state of mind.Robbins depicts Andy Dufresne to be a reserved, humble protagonist. It is well-known that other actors were considered to play this role, such as Tom Hanks, but I believe Robbins's presence works wonders for the storyline, allowing Andy to have a quiet temperament that lets him seem at peace with himself. He has nothing on his resume close to his performance here. Freeman puts on arguably the greatest performance of his lifetime in this movie. His narration lets the viewer connect even further with all the characters, and has a poignance that stays with you long after the credits roll. His \"rehabilitated\" speech ranks right up there as one of the all-time great movie moments.Character development is greatly utilized here. Pop culture references (Rita Hayworth, Hank Williams, John F. Kennedy) help give one the impression of the passage of years, and Andy's brave, witty exploits make him a likable hero. Violence and death are also put to use, with several characters dying within the story. We are made to embrace these seemingly real individuals during their airtime, and are hence moved by their tragic deaths. The failures of these characters make the final scenes of the film all the sweeter.Another standout feature of The Shawshank Redemption is the music. Oh, the music! Thomas Newman's musical score shines brightly and lends another dimension to this heartfelt tale. The triumphant piece heard at the end is one that you've likely heard before  as it has been used in movie trailers all over the world. The fact that The Shawshank Redemption did not win an Oscar for its musical score (or in any category for that matter) is almost incomprehensible. Though in a '94 class along with Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, and The Lion King, I suppose it can be understood.I will note that it is a definite 'must see' for all those who consider themselves \"movie connoisseurs\". There are not too many negatives (if any) that can be said on the film. I will state, however, it's current #1 ranking on the IMDb Top 250 is a little bit high though.I guess I'm a little nit-picky, but my main beef is with the ending. The whole movie is about hope. *SPOILERS ALERT* If you wanted hope, then you should not have ended on a cheesy last scene where the old friends reunite and everything is alright. *SPOILERS END* It was touching, no doubt about it, but then the message of hope is dwarfed by our excitement that the two friends are together again. We leave the movie smiling instead of thinking. What I'm trying to say is that to make the core message stick to the viewers, the movie should have ended the scene before, when Red boards the bus and says, \"I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams",
      " I hope.\" And as the bus drives away from the camera, the credits roll. But again, that's only an honest opinion.Watch this film alone and with attention and it will really get you involved and thinking and thats the beauty of it. I recommend it to everyone who enjoys watching beautiful cinema. I rate it 9 out of 10.For the end i leave Andy Dufresne's quote \"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies\"",

      "Stephen King's powerful prison drama story is brought to life, with Frank Darabont's \"The Shawshank Redemption\". The movie tells the story of Andy Dufresne, portrayed brilliantly by Tim Robbins, who is sent to Shawshank prison, when framed as the murderer of his wife, and her affair lover. During his time in prison, Andy makes an unlikely friendship with smoke dealer \"Red\", portrayed by the astounding Morgan Freeman, who does an excellent job of guiding the movie with his smoothing, and confident narration. Now, the rest of the movie talks about Andy's struggle to try and break free from Shawshank, and the unexpected friendship between two different people. This movie is an astounding masterpiece, that can only be spoken through the words of the mysteriously defying Stephen King. Director Frank Darabont helped bring King's vision to life on the screen, and he performed an excellent job as a director, and a writer. Also, the cast is such a true miracle, that the movie was able to get the finest actors to play the most finest cinematic roles. Tim Robbins is excellent, Morgan Freeman is astounding, Bob Gunton is brilliant, and James Whitmore plays such a dramatic small role as \"Brooks\", the Shawshank librarian. Also, I enjoyed Thomas Newman's breathtaking score, the perfect cinematography, the excellent use of film editing, and the spectacular script. I respected every single moment in this movie, and it had me wanting for more. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is one of the best movies ever made, and I have never seen a movie with so much heart before, even though of it's slow 142 minute run-time. \"The Shawshank Redemption\", in my review, \"a stunning masterpiece, entertainment at its finest\". \n",

      "What can be said that already hasn't been. Shawshank Redemption is a spectacular film which focuses on Hope and fear. Morgan Freeman does what he always does, delivers a fine, unforgettable performance. With a voice like that it extremely hard too. As Red, Freeman narrates the tale of how a man wrongly accused of Murder, is sent to life in prison and has nothing but hope to cling on.Stephen King epitomise great storytelling. You don't need twists every scene nor do we need a complex plot that tries to hard to stand out. With colourful characters and fantastic interactions, a story can truly become personal. OK, many here has probably never been sent to prison for something they didn't do but this doesn't stop anyone from imagining the fear and hopelessness that one must go through when stripped from their freedom and rights.There only few films out there that makes the most out off every shot. Shawshank is one of those. There not one wasted second, no scene which could or should of been cut from the final version. Everything is done to perfection. You can feel and sense the delinquency and effort put into the film which luckily for us, makes the viewing that extra special.Pointless it may seem, writing a review for a film which has already been critique to death, but heck, a little more praise won't do any harm. Yes, you will get your snobs who will bang on about how this film doesn't deserve to be number one, but those are the ones who believe a story must be plagued by thought provoking twists. All i have to say is that Shawshank is a heart warming tale that will no doubt leave you in a fuzzy ball of warmth and amazement when the credits begin to roll down on this extraordinary tale \n",

      "\"The Shawshank Redemption\" isn't only a movie these days; it's a statement of purpose for underdogs and anyone who ever felt trapped underfoot by a system they didn't understand. Yet watching the film with that knowledge doesn't obscure the fact it is a highly satisfying emotional thrill ride worth taking again and again.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary in 1947 for the cold-blooded murder of his wife and her lover. Over the next 19 years, he does what he can to stay above the mire, consisting not only of the cruelty of his fellow inmates but the heavy hand of a brutal warden, Norton (Bob Gunton), a sadist who thumps his Bible while telling his charges that \"salvation lies within.\" Andy's stubborn refusal to give up hope in the face of his incarceration engenders the wonder and friendship of several inmates, especially \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who nevertheless wonders about Andy's state of mind.\"Hope can drive a man insane,\" Red warns Andy. \"It's got no use on the inside.\" Andy doesn't agree.It's true what other commenters say: You can't pass two-and-a-half hours much more quickly than by watching this. There's enough cleverness, good humor, and uplift to power five Hollywood blockbusters, and terrific acting from the stars to the day players. Based on the Stephen King novella, \"Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption,\" it's the gold standard of King adaptations thanks to the powerhouse work of writer and first-time director Frank Darabont, who uses Freeman's narration to inject King's voice into the proceedings.Robbins is a great lead, physically towering over the rest of his cast, his quiet authority reminiscent of James Stewart, whose famous film \"Harvey\" Dufresne even references at one key moment. But Freeman is the film's secret strength, playing \"the guy who can get it for you\" with a note of welcome ambiguity. Watching him in an early scene, when a fat, new convict (\"fresh fish\") is being beaten by cruel head guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), you don't know whether Red looks so crestfallen for the victim or for the packs of cigarettes he just lost betting the guy wouldn't break before Dufresne.\"Shawshank\" is otherwise not ambiguous at all. The bad guys are vile, justice is served up on a heaping platter, and a final scene is too on-the-money for its own good. But the ride getting there is so true and natural, so minutely well calibrated with its lived-in details, that you can't really deny this film's classic status, nor want to. It's a deserving King Of The Hill for the IMDb 250.But why is it so highly regarded beyond that, as a film whose message touches so many so deeply? Like so many others, I think the notion of Shawshank prison as a metaphor for life has much to do with it, the idea that however dark and embroiled in life's miseries we become, its belief that \"a warm place without memory\" is not out of reach pulls us in. You can see a religious message in such a notion if you are so inclined, and many are, yet the film is clever enough to work on other levels, too.Finally, it's a great story, well told. People will always have a need for such stories, especially when the things they tell us are as fine and noble as they are here. Andy wants out of \"Shawshank\" bad, but for viewers it turns out being a fine place to serve time in. \n",

      "I have this film on DVD and it's one of my favourites. That said, it's been several years since I sat down and watched it and I hoped it was still as good as I remembered. It might be worth pointing out here that I've been a huge Stephen King fan since I was at school, probably a good 30 years all told. I have every book in general circulation, and I've read a lot of them more than once. Different Seasons must have been one of the first books of his that I bought when it first came out, way back in '82 or '83. It's a collection of four unrelated novellas, other than that each title has a different season mentioned in the subtitle. The first of the novellas is Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption: Hope Springs Eternal, and it is, in my opinion, by far the best. If you haven't read it, I would thoroughly recommend it, particularly if you haven't seen the film as the movie stuck pretty closely to the original story so there won't be many surprises in store for you otherwise. Incidentally, if you've ever seen Rob Reiner's movie Stand by Me or Bryan Singer's Apt Pupil you'll find two of the other stories in the collection pretty familiar too. But I digress, back to the movie in question.I wasn't disappointed. This is undoubtedly a great movie and thoroughly deserves it's place at the top of the list. The performances from Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman are superb and the friendship between their characters develops over 20 years or so is entirely believable. You see them, particularly Freeman, get gradually broken and institutionalised as the film plays out. And then, of course, you get that fantastic feel- good ending that you really wanted, but somehow never actually expected. But it's not just the performances from Robbins and Freeman that delight. Both Bob Gunton, the sadistic and greedy warden who somehow believes he is doing God's work, and Clancy Brown (remember him as the Kurgan in Highlander?) as the equally sadistic, almost sociopathic Captain Hadley, give wonderfully sinister performances.Most of the other prisoners, with the possible exception of James Whitmore's Brooks, are fairly two-dimensional, but then the director almost seems to gloss over them deliberately to keep the viewer's attention firmly directed towards the two leads and their developing bond.The film begins in the 1940s, and continues on until the 1960s so it was essentially a period piece when it was made. This has stopped it becoming dated in any way. Also, because it's set in a prison which appears almost completely isolated from the outside word, the passage of time is easy to miss. The movie is as engrossing now as it was 15+ years ago when it was first released. At two and quarter hours, it's probably one of the longer films in the list (although by no means the longest), but it keeps the viewer's attention for the full duration, and never seems to lose its sense of direction. Every scene pushes the plot forward in some way.A definite 10/10 from me, and thoroughly recommended. \n",

Count my words you will watch this movie that many times. It's a story about hope as many people have already said in the review also about friendship and almost all these great human emotions.

The amount of situations and experiences I could relate to and empathize with was incredible. The simplicity of the message within the complication of human interaction and misunderstanding. It was a shocker. The extent of rawness people can portray towards each other versus the compassion was wound together like yin and yang. We can't really have one without the other.Since, I have seen this movie several times.

      "In 1995, when I was fourteen, out of the blue, I saw in a newspaper, that one of my favorite Stephen King stories, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, had finally made its way to the silver screen.It wasn't showing at the Hoyts/Greater Union cinemas, rather a local independent/art-house cinema. Of course, that didn't bother me so I went. Over 2hours long, Shawshank swept you into another world. Stephen King's short-novel was very faithfully adapted. Three pieces of brilliance stood out then, and still do today. 1 First, the film was brilliantly paced, never a dull moment. Having read the short-novel before hand didn't diminish any expectations. 2 Second a brilliant cast. Sheer brilliance from Morgan Freeman, and Tim Robbins, as Red and Andy Dufresne. Very strong supporting cast in Bob Gunton - the cruel Warden Sam Norton, other inmates: Gill Bellows as young Tommy Williams, James Whitmore, the elderly Brooks (brilliant expansion of character, that short novel only dealt with in two paragraphs). Yet the show was stolen by Clancy Brown. Brown's legendary performance as Captain Bryon Hadley, one guy you clearly didn't want on your case! 3 Finally what remains in my mind the most, from Red's last parole-hearing, to the end of the film. Words can't simply convey the emotions, this was what I didn't except. It was so powerfully done. My favorite quote: Andy Dufresne: \"Get busy living, or get busy dying. \" Enough said. \n",

      "You go into a film hoping to be entertained. That's the least you can expect. If a film manages not only to entertain but also to inspire then you've really got something. Such is the case with The Shawshank Redemption. Few movies are as inspiring and uplifting as this tale of...an innocent man rotting away in prison? Well that doesn't sound particularly inspiring. Sounds depressing even. But this movie will surprise you. At times along the way it is rather bleak, things seem hopeless. But the movie's hero never gives up hope. He is not content to sit in prison and rot. Get busy living or get busy dying. Is there ever really any doubt which of those options Andy Dufresne will choose?In 1947 Andy, a banker on the outside, is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary for life after being wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He befriends a prisoner named Red, a man popular amongst his fellow inmates because Red is the man who can get things. Most of the men want the typical prison contraband. Cigarettes are the big item. Andy's different. He wants a tiny little rock hammer to maintain his rock collection. And later he asks for a Rita Hayworth poster. As the years go by Rita becomes Marilyn, Marilyn becomes Raquel. It's as good a way as any to mark the passage of time. Time marches on. The world moves on. But the men of Shawshank are left behind. That would be hard enough to take even if you were stone-cold guilty, a menace to society. For an innocent man like Andy Dufresne? You wonder how he cannot be utterly defeated by life. Yet somehow he maintains a sense of calm and a great inner strength. There's something about this guy.What exactly is it about Andy Dufresne? Hard to say because the story is never really told through his eyes but rather through those of his friend Red. We come to know Andy only to the extent that Red does. And for this story that setup really works. Tim Robbins is excellent in the role of Andy, the film's hero figure, but Morgan Freeman has perhaps the more challenging job in playing Red. Freeman's character serves as the audience's eyes and ears. And he also serves as the movie's voice. Extensive use of voice-over narration in films can be an iffy proposition, often proving more distracting than helpful. But Freeman's voice, Red's voice really, narrates this story beautifully. Playing off one another wonderfully Robbins and Freeman make a terrific team. This is a movie content to let its two main characters just sit around and talk. True, there's not much else to do inside those prison walls. But some of the shared moments between Andy and Red are as poignant as any you'll see in any film and the two actors deserve their due credit for making it so.You wouldn't go so far as to call it slow but the movie certainly proceeds at a deliberate pace. This is a story which takes its time in letting you know where it is ultimately headed. It's essentially Andy's story, as told by Red. But there is room for some other characters to carve out their place as well. Most touching is the story of elderly prisoner Brooks, as played beautifully by James Whitmore. His little story within the story definitely tugs on the heartstrings. Of course for any movie to truly succeed there has to be some conflict and for that we have guard Byron Hadley and warden Samuel Norton. At least Hadley is upfront in his evilness. Norton's one of film history's biggest hypocrites, walking around the prison spouting Bible verses all the while being engaged in all manner of unseemly activities. This is a man who needs a comeuppance. But in the world of Shawshank it is Norton who has all the power. This is a story seemingly destined for a very unhappy ending. The righteous man does not seem at all likely to prevail. But, slowly but surely, the movie continues to build towards something. What that something will be you can't quite be sure. But when the moment comes where all is revealed the film's ultimate triumph is secured. For you have seen not only an entertaining and utterly compelling story. You've seen something which can't help but make you feel better about life in general. This is a movie to see when you need to have a little of your faith in humanity restored. It may not be, as it is in some places proclaimed to be, the best movie ever made. But is an undeniably excellent movie which has rightfully become rather beloved by most everyone who sees it. \n",

People watch Shawshank and someone truly may believe in HOPE. They may truly believe their lives will get better. They may truly believe others' lives can be made better. Its message is not only told, but it is FELT and oft times ABSORBED. For men, for women, for old, for young, for everyone. It is a masterpiece. What other movie affects people in this way?

You feel more than that.You will never see another like it. And the mere perfection of this movie, by a novice director, will frustrate experienced and future directors forever. \n",

      "I'm a big fan of movies that have depth and tells a great story. American movies doesn't always provide that.The Shawshank Redemption, however, is a prime example of what American story telling can be. With a slight non-linear build up, strong and patient character development, the movie drags you more and more into the despair of Andy Dufresne, but always with a sense of hope.For me, there's no two ways about it. This is simply the best movie ever made.10/10. \n",

      "It took me 10 years to see this movie; I dated a guy who constantly talked about it 7 years ago; but I never did see it. I am not into prison movies; so I kept telling him I didn't want to see it. Whenever it came on television, I would go into another room and watch something else. I just thought he liked it because he has been in prison before; and it reminded him of being in there or something (silly me).But, this Labor Day Weekend (2005); when it came on again; I decided to sit down and just look at it for the first time. Well; was I pleasantly surprised and glad that I did finally see it. Great plot, good direction, characters that had some depth and the surprise ending too boot. Also, just to be able to see Morgan Freeman act is a treat me for anyway; he is such a great actor. He finally won the Academy Award that he so richly deserved all of these years for Million Dollar Baby. He got robbed of the Academy Award for \"Driving Ms. Daisy\" and for \"Lean on Me\"; but he finally got what was due him.I also liked Tim Robbins portrayal of his character, as he was quiet, and smart. You know, being quiet sometimes can help a person get through many difficult ordeals in their life. Folks have a tendency to ignore you and don't pay much attention to you then. I learned how to be quiet and not so loud all the time; thinking is better than talking in certain situations.Before I saw this move, I was not being treated well at work by my boss, and struggling with how to handle it. Seeing this movie actually helped me to do something positive about it. My boss and my job will never be the same.Andy was right; we need to get along with the business of living or the business of dying; and living is much better.P.S. I broke up with the guy I was dating 7 years ago; he was a jerk.Sanctified Minister Chicago, IL \n",

      "Like many of the reviewers, I hate prison movies with all the clichés and stereotypes of innocent prisoners, nasty guards, and evil wardens; and upon first viewing, many years ago, I especially disliked being forced by this film to feel sympathy and empathy with murderers, rapists and the like.Shawshank has somehow transcended the test of time; and I believe that it has endured, not because of the great performances (which don't seem to be acting at all, but real), not because of the simple, but multi-level, story line with its twists and turns, not because of its magnificent photography, not because of its score, and not because of any individual element that went into the making of this film. (Hence, the lack of academy awards.) However, when all those elements are combined, Shawshank becomes one of those masterpieces which is greater than the sum of its parts...and this film is so much greater that in the desperation of its characters, it invokes a multitude of good emotions in the viewer...that there is divine, poetic justice and hope in this hell of a world.Shawshank has become my favorite film of all time, but it took a while. \"When your're feeling down and out, watch Shawshank!\" Raising my vote from 8/10 to 10/10 (however subjective that vote may be.) \n",

      "For quite some time, I've been hearing how good The Shawshank Redemption is. But Unfortunately, I never got the chance to see it. After seeing it last week, I can safely say that the movie lives to the hype, it even exceeds it.The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robbins ), a hotshot banker who's convicted of murdering his wife and his lover, and who's sent to jail. In the prison, Andy meets Red ( Morgan Freeman ), a \" man who knows how to get things \". And a friendship begins between them.There are many great aspects about the movie. I'll begin with the most obvious one, the uplifting tone. When The Shawshank Redemption ended, I was so happy I cried happy tears, I was never happier after watching a movie.The story of the movie is so simple, yet it's very touching and effective. We spend almost half the movie watching 2 men ( Andy & Red ), talking and walking in the prison yard. Slowly we get to know them better, and in the meantime absolutely fall in love with them. I think friendship was never portrayed better in movies.One of the best things about the movie is the acting. Morgan Freeman was never better in my opinion, Tim Robbins gave a very good performance, but I think he was better in The Player, and the supporting cast ( Bob Gunton, William Sadler, and Gil Bellows ) was pretty good too.Frank Darabont's directing is flawless. He was able to make us believe we're watching a real prison, helped in that by the great cinematography. He excelled in creating the right mood for both the uplifting scenes ( the opera scene, the library scenes ) and the depressing scenes ( the scenes with Brooks, and the rape scene ). It seems Darabont is at his best when he's making movies set in prisons, as evidenced by The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. When he tried to change that in The Majestic, the results were so-so.So, I definitely recommend watching The Shawshank Redemption, if you haven't watched it already. This is truly one of the best movies ever made. \n",

Nothing that this film says challenges any principle or thought- its purpose is to confirm every conservative, sentimental, instinct in us all. And yet it has a sense of its own putative profundities, and bulldozes these throughout the film. Really what the film is saying is neither profound nor original, and is not to my mind worth saying in the first place at least not at such length- ie life is hard, people suffer, but through struggle the human spirit will win through, learn to make friends and get their deserved reward - mmm. Nothing makes any of the characters real, and the actors are not helped by this terrible overloaded narration which applies a great weight on the story which cannot breath as every moment is made to seem sooo significant. It is not just that there is no lightness of touch in the direction, or that there is no humour, it is that there is a sense that what is being described is more important than humour, or than the real nature of friendship. Suffice to say i loathe this film and recommend people watch it only as a lesson in what is bad about big budget Hollywood movies. \n",

The acting is fine, the twist is gratifying (if a little predictable) and some of the shots are fantastic. However, the film is let down by unrealistic dialogue, especially on the part of Freeman's character, who does not seem able to construct a sentence without using a string of metaphors and similes.The prison warder is a one-dimensional villain with very little allure - we, the viewers, are not credited with much intelligence. Because he is a villain, it therefore follows that he must a be a Nazi, no? Cue references to book-burning etc. Furthermore, the portrayal of Tim Robbins' character as Christ is slightly offensive (check out the shot in which he is shown with his arms thrown up to heaven).In true Hollywood style, there seems to be about five 'endings' - when we think that the excitement (or otherwise) is over, another sequence is tagged onto the end. Despite some fairly violent scenes, life inside Shawshank seems actually rather appealing - a library, plenty of time outside the cells. This, combined with the film's massive length, means that for my mind, The Shawshank Redemption merits only a 6/10. \n",

      "My favorite movie was really The Godfather until I saw The Shawshank Redemption.A lot of people would might disagree with, but I love this movie. the actors are great, the director has done a fantastic job and the screenplay is magnificent.I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.I remember, when i saw the movie I didn't want to get up and go to the toilet. When I finally was done in the bathroom, I couldn't wait to get back and press play on my DVD. At the time I was done with the movie I wanted to see the movie again.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget. So see it, buy it, love it. \n",

I would give it to Kubrick's The Shining, but it's more like Kubrick took the story idea and did his own movie on it. In other words, while it's a classic, it's not that great of an adaption. Andy Dufresne is wrongly imprisoned for murdering his philanderous wife and while in prison befriends a prisoner named Red, who is great at getting outside products to the inmates. The message of the film is strong and clear : Hope Hope Hope is a beautiful thing. The film is about triumph. About friendship. It's also about some knockout acting.

The film more or less focuses on the friendship between Andy and Red, played beautifully by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Morgan's deep and moving voice was perfect to describe the closeness of his friendship with Andy. The film had a great happy ending where Andy escaped from the prison after serving almost 20 years, he also managed to expose the prison as there was murder and corruption going on there, Andy moves to a beautiful island abroad and when Red is paroled after serving 40 years in prison he is reunited with Andy, it was a great ending to a beautiful movie. \n",

Yet, if one digs deeper into it, those that know movies should be able to see its weaknesses. Its dialogue for one is not very strong.

Hmmmm....Among prison movies, Cool Hand Luke is better--more realistic, and without the obligatory Hollywood feel-good ending.

And, they go out of their way to show you that the despised hate-filled warden is a Bible Believer, of course. It's repeated and demonstrated several times as the warden quotes Scripture. And our hero (Tim Robbins) carves out the middle the Bible to use as a place to hide a tool for him to escape. Heaven forbid, the Book would be used for him to actually read! It's no coincidence since this is written by famous author and Christian-basher Stephen King.Amid the bigotry is an interesting story with two likable lead characters (the other being Morgan Freeman, whose narration in the film is superb) and a very satisfying ending. Along the way we get other clichés, such as the usual sadistic guard (Clancey Brown) who beats up defenseless nice guys. This movie is so manipulative it's laughable.....but entertaining, especially if you're another Bible basher are another naive Lib who thinks that jails are filled with intelligent, sweet-natured guys like Freeman, Robbins, et al.

I give everything a chance, in fact -- several chances. But sometimes not all things appeal to all people. For me, this was one of them.

      "Watching this film made me think about the genre of \"prison\"-movies and what the theme really is in these stories. All of them seem to have some common elements; the warden is a psychopath, there is almost always some inmate that is out to get the protagonist in some way, there is the companionship and last but not least the portrayal of the human spirit that will not be broken in the direst of circumstances. And maybe that is what \"shawshank\" wants to tell us; that the strong individual can beat an unfair and cruel system by different means. In this story we have Andy Dufresne who is clever but also able to endure visits in \"the hole\" many times without developing psychiatric phenomena. In this sense I will claim that this movie is just as much a piece of fiction as lets say \"starwars\" is. It is simply not possible to stay sane if you are repeatably treated in a degrading manner and if you live in constant fear. The movie is highly entertaining but should not be seen as a serious attempt to explore human reactions in a prison environment where inmates are treated as garbage. Don't fool yourself on this account. Luke Skywalker is just as real as the character of Andy Dufresne is.Regards Simon \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is reasonably well written, directed, acted, and filmed. Yet in my judgment it is a below-average movie. It lacks a real plot, and, while the title promises redemption, nobody and nothing is redeemed. The characters lack depth, and many events are implausible.No doubt, wardens and prison guards can be wicked people. But those portrayed in this film are so completely perverse that they become uninteresting. Their function is to represent \"the establishment\" and \"authority.\" The audience is meant to identify with Andy Dufresne, the main character. While innocent of the murders of which he is convicted, he's hardly an admirable character, and he becomes worse during his imprisonment. He's a clever manipulator who eagerly cooperates in the warden's criminal activities in the hope of profiting from doing so--which he eventually does. The prison also has has a contingent of homosexual rapists, who are called \"not human\" so as to avoid admitting that their behavior is all too human, and very much in need of redemption.Thus, the film's popularity: it appeals to our tendency to rationalize our own wickedness by comparing ourselves with moral monsters.

      "Many folk rate Shawshank Redemption as one of the best films they have ever seen. I'm not so impressed. Firstly, I agree that the absence of special effects is a boon in any 1990s film. Secondly, Freeman and Robbins act well and are well-directed. The storyline, though, lacks subtlety (not in the telling - this is a very well directed film - but as a story) and Dufesne comes over as a kind of everything-he-touches, incarcerated upper-middle class Forrest Gump. The film is suffused with a kind of Manichean morality which tips over too readily into sentimentality (again, despite the best efforts of Freeman and Robbins) and which, ultimately, I found cloying.Perhaps, though, I'm being too harsh. Is it just that the film is a lot better than the story from which it is taken? Rita Hayworth: eat your heart out? \n",

There are way better movies than this one and I really can't understand why so many people rate it 10!! 10 equals perfection and very few pieces of art come close to it!! I think 7 is a very high rating and this movie probably doesn't deserve more than an 8 maximum!! The masses don't necessarily appreciate subtle art and want to be entertained, that's what the movie industry is about! Still, this movie was quite gay! Way too much emo and way to predictable! \n",

      "Shawshank Redemption is a story of, well, Redemption. Just like any film from Quentin Tarantino, but with an extra dose of melodrama. Orchestral music to drive you to tears, overly dramatic dialog, and plot twists that come so far out of left field even M. Night Shylamalan would cringe. You just have a hard time seeing them, because the movie is relatively laid back.Which is the best part of the film. It slows down whenever it needs to take its time. It's the story of two prisoners who bond over. One is a wrongfully accused man hoping to find a way out. One is a man who has given up all hope. And random acts of kindness help them earn their redemption.See, it's about Redemption. It's in the title. No use thinking about the theme. Morgan Freeman is perfectly cast in this film, and gives one of the best performances in his life. But every one of his lines is not the line of a prisoner, but somebody who has been paid to pretend to be a prisoner.The movie lacks any sense of reality, from the poorly supervised chain gang, to the subplot of the sinister warden, and even down to the fact that a man is allowed to keep a tool made for chipping away rocks in his cell.The film would have worked as a stage play easily. Because we expect this detachment from reality. But this film likes to pretend this is reality. The film also likes to make conclusive statements, and then immediately retract them.This movie has a heart. It spills out all over the screen while we watch the characters monologue, getting to the point of the movie over and over again. Long movies never bothered me. On the contrary, I think it's a shame four hour movies never get released these days. Still, when it's two and a half hours plus of monologues reiterating the same plot point, it's two and a half hours too much. \n",

This is not to say that I enjoyed those scenes - I didn't - but it appeared that it was Frank Darabont's sophomoric attempt at instilling some sense of prison reality into an otherwise boring story about male bounding. I personally would not recommend this movie to anyone. \n",

But he isn't alone; he is joined by fellow inmate (who is the only guilty person in Shawshank) Red played also very well by Morgan Freeman.

Afer all, acting was great, I have no bad things say about that, it's only a bad script, for my opinion.

      "'The Shawshank Redemption' is that rare exception that transcends film itself to become a moving and harrowing experience. Based on a short story by Stephen King and brought to life for the big screen by Frank Darabont, one can only watch in awe as this story touches true greatness. Superb performances, commanding direction, smothering atmosphere, beautifully bleak cinematography. All the pieces come together, and do they ever. This is worth more than just a second look, this a modern masterpiece.There's a great sense of inspiration that can be found at the center of 'The Shawshank Redemption', and that's a story of hope. Hope through all that life throws at you, hope in midst of uttermost despair. We go on a journey with these characters, and their stories remain with us long after we leave them. Andy's attempt to maintain hope and Red's struggle to allow the thought of it into his life is a powerful story to be told, highlighted by the fantastic performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.What else is it but art? If a film can reach out beyond the annals of cinema and become larger than itself, something more than a movie to be entertained by, can it be considered art? 'Shawshank' marked Frank Darabont's first venture into the work of Stephen King ('The Green Mile' and 'The Mist' would follow), and it arguably remains his best and most accomplished effort to date. His ability to set the tone and create its smothering prison atmosphere instantly grabs your attention and never relinquishes it.'The Shawshank Redemption' is a deeply moving picture that has to be experienced, not observed. Felt, not merely seen. It tells an intricate story of extreme magnitude, leaving in its footsteps a poignant tale of hope and freedom. Allow yourself to be taken where films rarely go, the tragic beauty of it all is nearly overwhelming. A sweeping work of art to remind us that above all else, when all seems to be lost, never give up hope. As Andy tells Red, hope is a good thing. And no good thing ever dies.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public \n",

They lumber through the film as such obvious and simplistic bad guys that they may as well have moustaches and wear black hats.Secondly, the film cranks out every prison cliché in the book. The assaults, the corrupt wardens, the ex-con who can't handle the outside world, the withdrawals of privileges - all have been done before and with considerably more impact.Thirdly, there are plot holes you could crawl through (as Andy does!). The notion that Andy Dufresne could dig a tunnel for 20 years without being spotted isn't up-lifting, it's ridiculous. Did no-one feel the draught? Did no-one lean against the poster when they visited him in his cell? As a resolution, it's not clever, just silly.And the finale (from the tunnel to the beach) is overlong and overwrought.And yet there are standout sequences. The scene where Andy locks himself into the Warden's office and blasts an aria from Mozart's Marriage of Figaro over the prison Tannoy is sublime and haunting.An enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours, but no more than that. \n",

      "When I first saw this movie i was 16 and wasn't allowed in the theatre since it was rated R.  I asked some of the people standing in line if they would let me come in with them.  I don't know why I wanted to see it so much(the trailer wasn't that great).  But when I sat down and watched that opening sequence where the judge slams down that gavel for the poor Mr Dufresne and Red comes walkin in to the parol board i knew i was in for something special.  The cinematography  of that old prison was amazing.  As we hear more dialog coming from the two main characters our hearts go out to these \"brave souls\".  The character development is better than in any movie i've seen for a while.  You really start to care and feel for these imaginary people as if you knew them.  The more times i watch it on my laserdisc player, the more I can't believe how anyone could not at least \"like\" this masterpiece of filmmaking.  It really got the shaft at the oscars.  Tim Robbins should have at least been nominated.  I still don't think forrest gump had as much to offer about the human experience as \"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION\".  It really is a fantastic piece of work. Writing, acting, direction, and cinematography come together in this masterpiece. \n",

      "Good Movie. The first time I saw it, when it first came out in 1994, I thought that it was fantastic. But now that I have seen it approaching 15 times now (thanks to TNT), there a few things that I have noticed that have convinced me it does not deserve to be in the top ten or even the top 50 of all time.I find the film to be unrealistic. The prison seems to exist in some sort of hyper-reality where people are either bad guys or good guys but there is absolutely no grey area. The prison and the prisoners are also very clean, neither have the lived-in quality that you would expect. I do not know if this feeling I get from the movie was on-purpose by the director Darabont, but I feel as the though the authenticity of the movie is not there. I also feel as though the movie is very manipulative of the audience's emotions in the way that the story is used to make the viewer feel a certain way about a character. Of course all movies are manipulative in this way. But I am very aware of it when I watch Shawshank. I was also aware of it when I watch movies like The Green Mile or The Hurricane, I feel as though these movies do not give the audience an opportunity to decide for themselves. Lastly I think that this movie was carried by the supreme acting, and that if the Freeman and Robbins were not so good it would not even deserve to be in the top 250.Otherwise, I rooted for this movie get the oscar in 1994 because I thought it was a superior movie to Forest Gump. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is an adaptation of the short story, Rita Hayworth And The Shawshank Redemption from the novel Different Seasons by Stephen King.Now i won't bombard you with \"Oh! you HAVE too see it!\" or \"You haven't lived yet if you haven't seen this movie!\". To be honest, everything I write in this review is strictly opinionated but if I was talking to a friend who asks me what my favourite movie of all time is I would answer The Shawshank Redemption. This movie is not without fault but what makes this movie so special is that you unconsciously put them aside to witness this story unfold. I remember the first time I watched it when I was 13-14 years old. I watched it with my mother and the movie contained a lot of swearing but she didn't seem to mind them. I like to think she was so entangled in this story that she was unable to care that she had five children and a husband and to be honest, I don't mind that because...I myself could've be in the same position as her and would've probably done the same. What The Shawshank Redemption does is that if you watch it at the right time in your life, it could change how you view the world. And if you're wondering if my last remark was true, take it from a guy that actually was a victim to this wonder of a film.The Shawshank Redemption is a contender of the title of The Greatest Movie Of All Time. Now while I said that The Shawshank Redemption is my favourite movie of all time... I never said it was the best. That title belongs to 2001: A Space Odyssey but that's another review for another day.Finally, the real question is should you see it? And in my opinion, absolutely. If you have 2 hours and 40 minutes to spare go for it or if you're just really bored and want to watch something, The Shawshank Redemption will not disappoint. I remember Roger Ebert claiming that he adored the movie the second time round. Of course i'm paraphrasing but, I 100% agree with Roger Ebert's claim. This movie does get better every time you watch it. Even if you know every single line of dialogue, if you decide to re-watch it, knowing the twist and turns of it, you will forget about it instantly and relive the experience.As I said in the start of this review, I wasn't going to bombard you with predictable comments on how great the movie was and I think I held up my end of the bargain pretty well. Now I hope I will turn your head around and encourage you to watch this film as that is the job of the film critic. To tell you what movie is and isn't worth your time and money. And The Shawshank Redemption is the perfect example of a movie that is absolutely worth your time and money. 9/10 \n",

Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on \"that 'Rickshaw' movie.\" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men.

      "This legendary film, made in the same year I was born (1994), tells the story of Andy. Andy apparently is a normal guy, with a good career, a lovely wife and a well paid job. But suddenly all the things change when the main character of the film discovers that his wife has cheated on him and the police find Andy's wife killed next to his lover. For that reason Andy is supposed to be the killer and Morgan Freeman plays the role of the narrator of the story of Andy (a normal and introverted man) in prison. So as you can see this film has a good plot, with legendary actors as are Tim Robbins (playing the role of Andy) and Morgan Freeman (playing the role of Ellis Boyd \"Red\" the narrator and ringleader of the prison).

His death hits so hard because everyone had a connection with him, everyone had a feeling towards him. Now Red and Andy are perfect examples of character arcs, they both start in the same place and end up in a better situation then they were at the start, they comping off better off because in prison they have both changed from what they were Red a killer and Andy the man who feels sorry for himself, and the contrast between them the fact that Red comes out through the system he came out legally after coming in illegally and Andy coming in innocent and escaping illegally, showing prison changed him from what he was making the film a perfect idea of a character arc that every screenwriter in the modern day needs to watch because there are no characters like theses in film at all.

      "'The more I know, the more I come to know, how less I know'. After watching thousands of movies and having some hundreds with me currently. I found 'The Shawshank Redemption' now. I have been avoiding this for some time, thinking that it would be another usual prison drama stuff. But since, IMDb had top rating, nominated for 7 Oscars, and some good reviews.OMG what a movie- Amazing, how you get entangled in a web of deceit, and proving yourself innocent among those master treacherous is nothing less than impossible. Here how Hope takes charge and this proves when Morgan Freeman says at last \"Some birds are not to be caged as their feathers are just too bright\". Tim Robbins in role of Andy Dufresne is excellent in 'silent intellect on work' profile. Morgan freeman is not a surprise in \"Red\" as I have always liked his acting and not to forget his convincing voice.On first viewing it is the story of Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.The only other movie which I liked that far is \"Forest Gump\" and incidentally this was also released in 1994.

      "If I was asked about my favorite film, I would think for a rather long time about the answer. There are many well-rounded films that I enjoy, so choosing the best of them would be a complicated task. However, if I was asked about the films that I would name among the best, I would almost immediately recall \"The Shawshank Redemption\"a film proving that when a person has will power, a dream, and persistence, nothing is impossible.The film was released in 1994; it was directed by Frank Darabont, who is now one of my favorite directors (his \"Green Mile\" is also great). The main roles were played by Morgan Freeman (whose character, Ellis \"Red\" Redding, in this picture is a kind of secondary character, but as crucial for the plot as the main one) and Tim Robbins. It is necessary to mention that the film has been created according to the novel by Stephen King named \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\"; for me, almost all movies made after King's books are amazing (except, perhaps, \"The Shining,\" which is remarkable, in my opinion, only due to the performance of Jack Nicholson). Anyways, the film tells the story of an accountant named Andy Dufrene, whose wife had been found dead along with her lover. Andy was accused of a double murder and was sent to Shawshankone of the most cruelest prisons in America.My first impression of the film was that I was watching a typical Hollywood drama. However, after a while, I felt intrigued because the film turned out to be not as glossy and sleek as typical mass culture products are. It was telling an uncompromising story of a person who was unfairly accused and put into circumstances that anybody would find terrible. However, Andy Dufrene not only managed to survive in prison, but also found inner strength to pursue his dream, which was rather a simple one: to become free and rich, and live in the Mexican town of Zihuatanejo. And he manages to reach his dream: in the end, Dufrene escapes from prison, and the final scene shows him driving a sports car along the seaside.What I liked most of all was the actors' performances. Every person participating in the film acted so realistically that sometimes it seems you are watching a documentary. Perhaps, this is due to the influence of the place where the film was made; all the shooting was done in Mansfield penal colony, Ohio. All the characters are convex and credible, and sometimes I noticed being sympathetic towards some of them (like Freeman's Ellis Redding, for example); but then I realized that I was watching a film about prison, and Redding in fact was convicted for a triple murder.One of the film's strongest scenes (and one of my favorite) is when the prison's warden is reported that Andy Dufrene's cell is empty: he goes there to check it outand indeed, all he sees is a poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. Angry and anxious, the warden throws one of Andy's belongings at the poster, and surprisingly manages to make a hole in it. After he hurriedly tears the poster off the wall, he sees a tunnelthe tunnel Andy had been digging for more than 20 years of his imprisonment with the help of a small rock ax. This was the second thing I liked about the moviethe idea that hope never dies, and that will power can make any path possible, and any choice correct.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a great film to watch; some might find it stressful, because in fact it is a serious drama that shows a lot of injustice, violence, and other discouraging scenes. But, all this is needed to show how a single man with a dream and strong character can withstand all his misfortunes and change any life circumstances for the better. \n",

      "A monumental celebration of resiliency, The Shawshank Redemption explores eternal themes of hope and friendship through the story of a banker convicted of murder adjusting to a brutal new life behind bars.It's 1947 in New England, and young bank vice president Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to the sprawling Shawshank State Penitentiary to serve two consecutive life sentences. The prison is run by warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton), who believes in discipline and the Bible, and ruthless chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown). Andy initially sticks to himself and has to fend off the unwanted advances of a group of pathologically violent rapists. He then befriends resourceful long-timer Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), a leader among the prisoners and legendary for being able to secure any item from outside the prison walls - for a standard 20 percent mark-up.Andy finally establishes his reputation by helping Hadley save on his taxes. Norton then appoints Andy as his personal banker and chief tax-evader. Over the years, Andy uses his elevated position within the prison community to dramatically enhance the prison library, and helps several convicts to finish their high school education. But a shocking confession from a prisoner in another facility sets Andy on a collision course with Norton. 19 years into his sentence, Andy's determination to hang onto hope faces its ultimate challenge.A generally faithful adaptation of a Stephen King novella, The Shawshank Redemption is a dazzling achievement. Director and screenwriter Frank Darabont constructs a deeply moving essay on the adaptability of the human spirit, and the conflict between hope and despair when the future appears uniformly grim.Red: What are you talking' about? Andy: Hope. Red: Hope? Let me tell you something, my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. It's got no use on the inside. You'd better get used to that idea.Despite a running length of 142 minutes, The Shawshank Redemption never flags. Darabont sets a deliberate pace, Shawshank coming alive as a world onto itself, operating in its own version of normal and according to its rules of conduct. With the rich narrative, the old prison even becomes homey, the film succeeding in transforming the imposing walls and claustrophobic cells into a comfort zone where men's dreams struggle to stay alive against the demons of surrender.Red: These prison walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. Enough time passes, gets so you depend on them. That's institutionalized. They send you here for life, that's exactly what they take. The part that counts anyways.A sub-plot about Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore, in a touching performance), an old convict and the Shawshank prison librarian, is the spiritual hinge of the film. Brooks is released after serving a 50 year sentence and is unable to cope with life outside the prison walls. Worse, Brooks knew before his release that he would be lost in a world now completely foreign to him.Andy and Red potentially face the same fate. Red applies for parole at regular intervals, and is mechanically turned down. With the passing decades, his fear of getting out starts to become real, and he is content to lose his motivation. Andy insists that hope for a better future can never be lost, and in his quiet way works methodically to try and save both himself and his friend. The film ends with a rousing final 30 minutes, Andy's hope blossoming and embracing Red in an act of gallant salvation.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver two outstanding performances. Breaking the familiar pattern of friends with opposite dispositions, both Andy and Red are understated, saying more with stance and expressions than words and emotion, and maintaining an inner dignity in the face of adversity. Robbins has never been better, his eyes burning with the intensity of a man facing a mammoth wrong and gradually realizing that resolution will be years in the making. Freeman brings to Red his quiet but strong persona, the actor adding beautiful shadings to Red's attitude as the passing years rub off the edges and replace them with resignation.Andy: I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living' or get busy dying'. \n",

This story is put together very well and should appeal to most people who enjoy a movie that keeps you in suspense and really makes you feel involved. Be prepared for an emotional yet thrilling experience.The major plot of the story is about survival in prison and the outside life. There are two main character who are Red played by Morgan Freeman, and Andy played by Tim Robbins. They will team up in this film and teach each other how to survive. The theme is really as mentioned survival on the inside and outside. One man is coming in and cannot wait to get out, the other man is in and is scared to get out after so many years. The actors really make you feel their pain as they are doing their time, and you may even feel as if you are imprisoned with them in a sense. This is a very emotional movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, and keep you wondering what will happen next. The camera crew does an excellent job with the angling and filming to make everything feel realistic. Their use of lighting is perfect with scenes being darker when it is a shocking or scary time, and lighter when it is a happier day. This film is very well directed.This film has the perfect feel, the right actors, with a combination of the right director and writer to make one of the all-time best films. I am a person who watches a movie and that is it, but I could watch this over and over again. It shows how two people who are completely different can teach and learn from each other.

I don't know where in Stephen King's mind this story came from but it's certainly one of his best, if not his finest.The Shawshank Redemption may baffle some for its high rating on IMDb: all this rating stuff is subjective anyway. And in my subjective view The Shawshank Redemption has become a classic for a reason; it's finely cast, very well written and directed: Frank Darabont must LOVE his Stephen King considering this one of a few works he's done based on King's stories. And Shawshank is quite easily the cream of the crop for both people's works.If Back to the Future was essential viewing for the 80s from the 80s, the same thing applies to Shawshank for the 90s.

If you write an IMDb review in earnest, for example, about Shawshank Redemption being super awesome, you may want to be assessed for possible brain damage. Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie, it was good. The obstacles faced by the protagonist brought tears to my eyes more than once, I really was moved by his plight.

      "In my eyes, a marvelous film, but one of the best, if not the best film ever made? I wouldn't agree. I think there are a number of films with better stories, characters, meanings and film making out there. I think the incredible following behind this film has come became this is a film that can appeal to just about anyone. It is, perhaps \"impossible\" to hate. Where someone may watch 2001 and find it boring or too ambiguous, or may find the likes of Citizen Kane, The Godfather or Lawrence of Arabia to be overly long snooze fests, on average the number of these reactions are greatly reduced by a film like Shawshank because of its happy, neatly tied up ending and it most people may find it more entertaining.Please do not get me wrong, I do think this is a great film, and when I watch it I cannot find flaws AT ALL. I do not think though that a flawless movie is automatically the best movie, Pulp Fiction I would say is a better film, but still has little flaws here and there, like Butch Coolidge's uninteresting girlfriend getting a little too much screen time. What I love about this film is how it depicts prisoners, prisoners that have been sentenced to decades of isolation from the outside world. The film never really wants the audience to sympathize with any of the characters except Andy Dufresne, whom we know, or at least assume, is an innocent man. The film shows that prison, for a lot of these men, become their home, and they cannot withstand the outside world. The character Brooks goes into prison early in his adult life, but comes out when he's an elderly man, and cannot handle how much the world has changed, its things like this that I appreciate about this film.I greatly recommend this film to anyone and everyone, however, I do not believes that this film deserves the #1 spot on the IMDb Top 250, for me it should be around the 70-80 mark, but that's just my opinion. \n",

      "Based on the acclaimed novella by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is a film burning with a certain sense of triumph that is rarely experience in any cinematic effort. It is a drama that stops at just about nothing to grab at your heart while feasting it with a strong human touch. This effort is accomplished by director Frank Durabont who, in his directorial debut, grasps on a powerful hold on the spirit of Stephen King's original source material. Taking from the pages of the novella of the same name, the film sets its action inside the walls of the federal penitentiary, a dark place where some of the most innocent people are incarcerated while they hopelessly watch as they are robbed of their humanity at the hands of the unpleasant nature within the prison. While some are thrown in prison for their lack of innocence, others lose their innocence while serving their time within the barbed wire fences and rusty cells. The primary focus of this bleak, yet triumphant tale, however, is the man who vows to fight against this tragedy. Set in 1947, this film follows Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins), a man sentenced to forty years in prison after wrongly being accused of the murder of his cheating wife and his lover. Stationed at the Shawshank Prison in New England under the watchful eye of religious bible-thumping Warden Norton (played by Bob Gunton), Andy is forced to deal with the harsh reality of the prison life, but soon finds a glimmer of hope when he forms a bond with fellow prisoner under the nickname Red (played by Morgan Freeman) who claims to be innocent. Following his years in prison, Andy seeks for redemption and decency among his fellow prisoners while struggling to survive against the unpleasant lifestyle uprooted by Norton. One thing everyone in that prison has in common is that they are all innocent, at least according to Red in a scene upon meeting Andy for the first time. But does he truly mean? That question lies within the story as it proceeds through a long, yet thoughtful process of establishing the emotional nature of the characters and the soul- crushing environment that has them shaken to their cores. But as Red states, \"you become use to it\". Whether one can agree with Red's claims or not, it is his wisdom that establishes him as a character with an emotional force to reckoned with. And kudos can be given to Frank Durabont's absorbing script, this character would not the shining light he is without the outstanding performance by Morgan Freeman who amplifies the role is just enough emotional magnitude to tap at the heart, while also dominating the film with his narration. The bond between him and Tim Robbins strikes the chord in more ways than one, especially with Robbins embracing the role with pure grit. Andy is a tragic character who is forced to come to terms with the reality that innocence is lost regardless of when it is in your control, and that leaving does not always mark the end of your tragedy. One character in the film is forced to learn that the hard way in one heartbreaking sequence. The film never grabs at your heart with strangling you with forced sentimentality, it just allows its emotions to run wild while sprinkling small bursts of humor to occasionally lighten the tone. In the midst of the melancholy at defines the atmosphere, there is a powerful sense of hope that Andy will not let the prison become the thief of his dignity nor his humanity, particularly at the hands of Bob Gunton's Warden Norton, a corrupt individual tainted with his religious hypocrisy. How can one trust a man who shoves his bible in their face, yet expresses himself in such an inhuman manner? And for a technical standpoint, shout-outs go to Roger Deakins for his profound cinematography to capture the nature of each scene from start to finish. The Shawshank Redemption is a triumphant cinematic effort brimming with an uncompromising heart and sense of humanity within its roots. It is powerful picture that will leave you heartfelt one moment, then leave you choked up within the next. That is just an example how magnificent director Frank Durabont is at gripping you with such a strong human touch. Worthy of the name \"masterpiece\"? I definitely think so. \n",

      "Roger Ebert's review about this film:It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (\"looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over\"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison. \n",

Morgan Freeman performance is outstanding. It is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. \n",

      "The satirist William Donaldson, writing in his Dictionary of National Celebrity, defined Stephen Fry as 'a stupid person's idea of what an intelligent person is like'. It's an ungenerous quip, but loaded with just enough truth to really sting  and by the same token, The Shawshank Redemption could be described as the all-time favourite film of people who haven't seen very many. Frank Darabont's uplifting prison drama has been perched at the top of the Internet Movie Database's top 250 chart, which is voted for by the website's users, since 2008  one place above The Godfather, and 58 above Vertigo, the Greatest Film of All Time as triangulated by Sight & Sound magazine in their international poll of critics last year. Those same critics showed little love for Darabont's creation: against Vertigo's 191 votes, The Shawshank Redemption received just one. Why should that be? Darabont's film is a handsome, well-acted tale of physical imprisonment and spiritual escape  hardly box-ticking Hollywood product. It was the Hungarian-born director's feature debut, adapted as a labour of love from the Stephen King short story Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, and was well-reviewed on its release in 1994. Received wisdom has it that the film was a box-office flop, but that narrative doesn't quite hold up to scrutiny: after a slow start it recouped its budget in the US and took £2.3 million in the UK  hardly a record-setter, but by no means disastrous. It was also nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Morgan Freeman's rich-roasted turn as Ellis Redding, the veteran inmate of Shawshank State Prison who takes Tim Robbins's Andy Dufresne under his wing. Perhaps the reason we think of The Shawshank Redemption as unappreciated in its time is that in 1994, cinema culture was dominated by two very new-fangled films: Robert Zemeckis's Forrest Gump, which digitally airbrushed Tom Hanks into 40 years of US history, and Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, the snappy, scrappy herald of new American independent cinema. \n",

      "On Sept. 23, 1994, after a premiere at the Toronto film fest, The Shawshank Redemption hit theaters nationwide. The Morgan Freeman film eventually nabbed seven Oscar nominations. The Hollywood Reporter's original review is below: Castle Rock has tapped into the wellspring of yet another Stephen King novella, from the same collection as Stand by Me. While it seems unlikely that this well-wrought film about hope and friendship in a maximum security prison will do Stand by Me-level business, The Shawshank Redemption should appeal to a mature audience. The marketing challenge will be to lure a mainstream audience to this dark drama starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman with, to boot, an enigmatic title.Covering a span of time from 1946 to 1967, Shawshank focuses on the plight of a Maine banker, Andy Dufresne (Robbins), sentenced to two life terms for the murder of his wife and lover. Laconic and a bit chilly, Andy is somewhat of an outcast among the uneducated, macho thugs who make up the main brunt of the prison population.Admittedly, he's not an easy guy to get to know and only comes to enjoy a prison friendship when he makes a deal with the prison black-market supplier, Red (Freeman), to get him a tiny hammer for his rock collection. Red is also an enigma to most of the inmates. He keeps his nose clean and his hopes up even though the parole board routinely denies him pardon, obviously a racial antagonism.While the story roils with some rousing prison-type action and is coarsened by an overpowering sense of frustration, The Shawshank Redemption is really about the unlikely friendship between Andy and Red: Each nurtures the other and serves as a touchstone for keeping their sanity intact.Frank Darabont's writing and direction are generally crisp, but Shawshank is a tough watch and audiences could use some time cut from its 142 minutes.In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenance's and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring.Technical contributions are well-crafted, particularly cinematographer Roger Deakins' forbidding lensing. Filmed in a garrison-like former prison in Mansfield, Ohio, Shawshank is often overwhelming in its depiction of the granite-cold, stony horror of prison life. Most splendid is Thomas Newman's somber score, which, at its best moments, alights with radiant textures and sprightly grace notes, nicely emblematic of the film's central theme. \n",

Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.

      "\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a \"prison drama\" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word \"redemption\" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. \n",

      "I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about to tell you why.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with \"Red\" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world- class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other.

      "\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is currently the highest-rated film (on average) on the IMDb website, a position it has held for quite some time. After a recent re-watch, I completely understand the sentiment, and (at least for me) the reason is fairly simple: this is a film that doesn't fit into any certain genre box. Drama? Prison Movie? Caper film? Emotional tear-jerker? Yes to all. My favorite films are the ones that supersede labels, and \"Shawshank\" does exactly that.For a basic plot summary, \"Shawshank Redemption\" tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a man condemned to two life sentences in the maximum-security prison for the murder of his wife. While in Shawshank, Andy quickly befriends Red (Morgan Freeman), a man who \"knows how to procure certain items\" that Andy wants/needs. Andy, through his analytical wisdom, also gets in the good graces of iron-fisted Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and lead guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) by his ability to do tax returns and basically run the prison's money-laundering scheme. While initially this affords Andy some luxuries that other prisoners do not receive, including his persistence in building up the prison library, eventually he comes to a crossroads: become institutionalized or fight back against the system.Without giving away the ending spoilers for those who may not have seen it, \"Shawshank Redemption\" is one of those movies that expertly balances the \"side quests\", so to speak, with the main plot arc, and everything comes out perfectly. That is a difficult thing to do in a film, as often the sub-plots crowd out the main storyline (instead of adding to it) or seem like filler. Neither of these things come close to happening here, as director Frank Darabont makes sure that balance is achieved.I feel like \"Shawshank\" is one of those movies that almost gets the short-shrift in \"greatest of\" conversations because it has become so iconic as to almost be \"too present\". The ending is now classic, Freeman's narration is perfection (this was before being almost comically typecast as \"narrator guy\" down the road in his career), and every single character is interesting and advances key plots or character development. Basically, \"Shawshank\" is almost too iconic for its own good in the sense that it never strays too far from the \"film consciousness\". One has to just make it a priority to sit down and watch it from beginning to end from time to time to truly appreciate its greatness.Perhaps the true staying-power of \"Shawshank\", however, is that it truly has \"something for everyone\" in terms of plot and characters. Some may get invested in whether Andy is guilty or innocent, others will marvel at his persistence in creating the prison library and contributing to prisoner education, while still others will identify with Red's side of the coin and how his character changes from the beginning of the film to the end of it. For me, the arc that always \"gets\" me (moving me to tears) is that of Brooks (James Whitmore), a prisoner for 40+ years at Shawshank who is finally released to the outside world. Despite the apparent freedom, Brooks cannot adapt to life outside the prison structure and social order. Living in a run-down apartment and bagging groceries at the supermarket, he conjures up plans to get himself back into prison where he can \"be somebody\" again. Basically, he has become \"institutionalized\", and that to me was maybe the most interesting theme in all of \"Shawshank\".Simply put, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a cinematic masterpiece of the highest order. If you haven't seen it yet, you are in for a real treat. Once your kids or relatives are \"of age\" to begin to comprehend the film's themes, show it to them too. Or, just sit down and watch it yourself for the ump-teenth time (like I just did). The characters will still be as vibrant and the themes will still be as applicable as the first viewing, and you'll likely pick up something new in every viewing experience. It is that expertly-crafted of a film. \n",

The story is rich, well crafted, detailed and is easily one of the greatest stories every put to film. Have all the issues about differences from the source material that you want but don't ever come to me and say the movie for this movie is weak because I will not be responsible for my actions. The fantastic themes of Hope V Fear that run through this movie elevate it above so many and is one of the many, many, many reasons I hold this movie on a pedestal. Get busy living or get busy dying. Tim Robbins was excellent as Andy Dufresne and this is easily his greatest performance. Dufrense is such a rich and interesting character that he easily stands as one of the best protagonists of all time. Morgan Freeman also gives a career defining performance as Red and this is probably the role he'll be remembered for. Red is, in my opinion, the greatest supporting character, ever put to film. He is so well written, so well acted, so well done that I could not poke a flaw in his entire character because there is none. Bob Gunton was fantastic as Warden Norton and is just a brilliant opposing force for Andy. Every single character in this movie had layers of depth and was just amazing to watch.

I didn't want this to be my favorite movie simply because it has the highest rating on this website. But, after taking the time to sit down and watch the whole thing I am 100% content with the fact that this has become my favorite movie, as of now... (5/13/17) \n",

      "Growing up with The Shawshank Redemption, I would always find myself being reminded of the lessons about life and morality that are taught through this movie. Being able to distinguish good from bad is an important skill and The Shawshank Redemption does an exemplary job at providing how people in difficult situations can still be able to overcome the oppression they are faced with. Each character in the film is an endearing component to the life of the movie which hammers its story home to the viewer. \n",

It tells a truly powerful story, and is an inspirational one at that. Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give stellar performances, and you truly care about what happens to each character. It's a tale on belief, hope, and the determination of what someone has to become successful. I've seen this movie about five times within the past year or so, and it still hasn't gotten old for me. This is definitely one of those movies that you have to see at one point in your life. \n",

I have never met anyone who doesn't like this film. The best thing about the film is getting to know the characters. The pace of the film is perfect. Every scene gives meaning to a great finish. This is basically a prison film that takes the time to let you get to know all the characters, where they come from, and in most cases where they are headed. No spoilers from me. If you have not seen this film then it will be much better knowing as little as possible about it. There is so much I can say about this film but I will end right here.

Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary. \n",

The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film.

      "On Sept. 23, 1994, after a premiere at the Toronto film fest, The Shawshank Redemption hit theaters nationwide. The Morgan Freeman film eventually nabbed seven Oscar nominations. The Hollywood Reporter's original review is below:Castle Rock has tapped into the wellspring of yet another Stephen King novella, from the same collection as Stand by Me. While it seems unlikely that this well-wrought film about hope and friendship in a maximum security prison will do Stand by Me-level business, The Shawshank Redemption should appeal to a mature audience. The marketing challenge will be to lure a mainstream audience to this dark drama starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman with, to boot, an enigmatic title.Covering a span of time from 1946 to 1967, Shawshank focuses on the plight of a Maine banker, Andy Dufresne (Robbins), sentenced to two life terms for the murder of his wife and lover. Laconic and a bit chilly, Andy is somewhat of an outcast among the uneducated, macho thugs who make up the main brunt of the prison population.Admittedly, he's not an easy guy to get to know and only comes to enjoy a prison friendship when he makes a deal with the prison black- market supplier, Red (Freeman), to get him a tiny hammer for his rock collection. Red is also an enigma to most of the inmates. He keeps his nose clean and his hopes up even though the parole board routinely denies him pardon, obviously a racial antagonism.While the story roils with some rousing prison-type action and is coarsened by an overpowering sense of frustration, The Shawshank Redemption is really about the unlikely friendship between Andy and Red: Each nurtures the other and serves as a touchstone for keeping their sanity intact.Frank Darabont's writing and direction are generally crisp, but Shawshank is a tough watch and audiences could use some time cut from its 142 minutes.In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenances and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring. \n",

      "This movie does right that many modern tales need is a focus on characters and their development through out the course of the tale. You will really care about the characters presented and will run a gamut of emotions while watching this.

The major protagonist is found guilty of a crime and you as the viewer are not sure that he committed and you spend the course of the movie on the prison grounds that he is sent. You see his relationships with who he comes into contact with and you see many mysterious uncovered during the course of his stay within this facility. You will really connect to him in regards to the joys and the struggles he goes through. This is also based on a Stephen King novel which is an added bonus, who is an amazing and talented writer in creating an atmosphere and well developed characters.

He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time. \n",

So, let's go back to the purpose of this review... Write about the movie, Shawshank is a movie about hope, about how someone can fight all the adversities that life can throw at them and get up with a smile on their face, how you can stay strong when everything seems so dark, how you can learn with the worst of the experiences. I gotta be honest, I'm pretty bad at writing in English(My first language is Portuguese) but I had to say something. I wasn't sure about watching The Shawshank Redemption but I'm so glad that I didn't listen to my unreasonable prejudices about old movies. I had seen a lot of wonderful old movies, and still, my mind has those setbacks with them.

The men are simple folk who are enslaved by thugs like wardens and guards with one credo: you can battle the entire world but you never betray a friend.

Instead, the chapters of the story are revealed like pieces of a great jigsaw puzzle. Each delicious piece might make us laugh or cry or smile or feel hatred for the racist 'man'.

      "Covering a span of time from 1946 to 1967, Shawshank focuses on the plight of a Maine banker, Andy Dufresne (Robbins), sentenced to two life terms for the murder of his wife and lover. Laconic and a bit chilly, Andy is somewhat of an outcast among the uneducated, macho thugs who make up the main brunt of the prison population.Admittedly, he's not an easy guy to get to know and only comes to enjoy a prison friendship when he makes a deal with the prison black-market supplier, Red (Freeman), to get him a tiny hammer for his rock collection. Red is also an enigma to most of the inmates. He keeps his nose clean and his hopes up even though the parole board routinely denies him pardon, obviously a racial antagonism.While the story roils with some rousing prison-type action and is coarsened by an overpowering sense of frustration, The Shawshank Redemption is really about the unlikely friendship between Andy and Red: Each nurtures the other and serves as a touchstone for keeping their sanity intact. \n",

It's one of the best book to film transitions ever. Stephen King's may be best known for his horror writing but this is not horror.

It celebrates the triumph of the human spirit. It's not a simple feel good movie- there is a good deal of brutality in it. As one of the characters explains: \"this is no fairy tale world.\"It is about a 20 year friendship between two men in a prison (in my opinion). In telling that story the narrative highlights the memorable moments. The film is also about long-term imprisonment. The movie is not driving towards it's conclusion. A lot happens, and the film just seems to amble confidently along like the film's main character. The conclusion comes about as just another story among other stories.

The story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not.

      "Before we can critically assess The Shawshank Redemption, we first have to deal with The Shawshank Reputation. In addition to its Oscar nominations and huge critical acclaim, the film has topped the IMDb Top 250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time soon. Any attempt to criticise it could come across as churlish or contrarian, the work of someone attempting to be above what is popular for their own self-righteous sake. Fortunately, there is little need to criticise - for Shawshank really is as great as people make it out to be. It's easy to forget how much of a slow- burning success Shawshank was. Despite favourable reviews and its many nominations, the film barely broke even on first release. It was only with the VHS release that word began to spread like wildfire, so that by the turn of the century it had garnered a reputation as a modern American great. In an age where films are dead in the water if they don't perform on opening weekend, it is hard to imagine a situation in which another Shawshank could emerge (although Slumdog Millionaire is a reasonable candidate). It's equally easy to forget how brutal the film is, particularly in its first 20 minutes. Shawshank's reputation as a popular favourite might lead the uninitiated to thinking that it's an uplifting, feel- good film - and it is true that these later moments are the ones which have most entered into popular consciousness. But any film about hope needs a source of despair to provide conflict, and Shawshank has more than enough violence and emotional trauma to justify its 15 certificate. As Mark Kermode famously remarked, there's a whole lot of Shawshank before the Redemption. Even without its reputation, Shawshank is one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work. Indeed, among King's dramatic stories, it is outshone only by its successor The Green Mile. Frank Darabont has a greater understanding of King than almost any other filmmaker: he gets the tone spot on and recreates the period setting brilliantly with the help of Roger Deakins' cinematography. Despite the much-parodied narration that punctuates the film, the drama unfolds naturally and believably throughout, with the characters always being at the forefront and naked exposition being kept to a bare minimum. Shawshank is a good example of how adaptation works - or more specifically, how changes made to the original story in translation often benefit the finished product. The best example of this is the character of Red, who in the original novel is a red-headed Irishman. This is referred to jokingly by Morgan Freeman in one of his first conversations with Tim Robbins; when Andy asks why people call him Red, Red responds: \"Maybe it's because I'm Irish.\". On top of Freeman's obvious ability, the casting decision makes sense because it adds an extra layer of meaning to the character. Red is one of the few black characters we come across; while he applies himself in different ways, he is as much of an outsider as Andy DuFresne. This is borne out by his remarks about institutionalisation, which are laughed off by his fellow inmates. Red may be well-connected when it comes to smuggling things in, but otherwise he is just as lonely as Andy. Shawshank approaches the theme of institutionalisation with great grace and dexterity. Because the story takes place over three decades, the temptation would be to canter through the plot points and cut straight to Andy's escape - you could even stage the entire story in flashback. \n",

      "Review from Roger Ebert: There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a \"prison drama\" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word \"redemption\" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine. \n",

Frank Darabont did an exceptional work respecting and bringing to the screen the style and emotion that Stephen King transmits when he writes a story. No wonder why on his first movie he received the nomination for best film. I can watch this movie over and over again and I still feel the same emotions. Doesn't matter if it is on a Saturday night stay at home movie or a Tuesday evening film on the TV. There is only one bad thing about this movie... and that is that it came out the same year as Forrest Gump. \n",

The only other film that comes even close to rivalling this masterpiece is The Grand Budapest Hotel. This film has the perfect story line with many good laughs right from the very begging however it has a perfect balance of making the audience feel good for the protagonists, and remembering what it is (a prison movie), putting the correct amount of hardship. This is a feature that so many films of today get wrong, leaving me bored in my seat. The Shawshank Redemption is a roller coaster the whole time, and shot with such class in directing. There is so much attention to detail in this film, such as Andy's and Brooks' scene in the old library where he times talking to Jake perfectly. This level of detail is unfortunately not seen today and films that are careless and without proper directorship are all too common nowadays unfortunately. I cannot believe that I hadn't seen Shawshank sooner, but I am very glad I have. I think its high esteem in my library will remain for many years to come. \n",

It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes. \n",

The Ntarampot changed the title, and considered that would mislead the public, in «The Shawshank Redemption». Two months it took to complete the script, which he claimed was the best he had ever read in his life. Immediately presented to companies and did not take long to start shooting. For the role of the banker Andy Ntoufrens producers think Tom Hanks and Kevin Costner, but the first two refused and chose Tim Robbins. O Costner few years later admitted that he regretted that decision. The Robbins spent some time in isolation to prepare mentally for the role of Andy Ntoufrens. For the role of the Red, the retentate coming in close contact with the Ntoufrens, the director chose Morgan Freeman, because of his voice. Although the description in the book did not fit his appearance Freeman as the Red supposed to be Irish, the director was erect. Indeed, Freeman today sees Red the most important role in his career.

      "ARE you going to get busy living or get busy dying?Stephen King's powerful message of hope is not lost in the stage version of his inspiring story, The Shawshank Redemption, at The Lowry in Salford Quays.Adapted by stand-up comedians Owen O'Neill and Dave Johns, the stage was transformed into 'Shawshank Penitentiary' as part of the play's first UK tour.It had a lot to live up to  Frank Darabont's 1994 movie of King's short story, starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, often tops lists of the best films ever made.But the excellent cast, led by EastEnders' Paul Nicholls, and director David Esbjornson brought existence behind the claustrophobic bars of a maximum security facility to life in front of the audience's eyes.The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Nicholls) who is serving two consecutive life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover  a crime he did not commit.Ellis 'Red' Redding (Ben Onwukwe) becomes his only friend and it is Red who narrates the story of how Andy changes the lives of all those around him by never giving up.Credit also goes to the stage designers  the grim prison sets helped put across the life of fear, constriction and routine where the dehumanizing behavior of the guards is often worse than that of the inmates.In this way, the limits of turning Shawshank into a play worked in the production's favor.Nicholls and Onwukwe are excellent as Andy and Red and their friendship is the thread that connects the story.Jack Ellis is chilling as the cruel, corrupt Warden Stammas and Andrew Boyer will break your heart as elderly prisoner Brooksie.The only disappointment was the ending which lacked impact. What happens to Andy at the end of his story is so powerful in the film version but  probably due to technical reasons  it is glossed over here.The play, set between 1947 and 1966 and peppered with music from the era, will make you ponder on the meaning of rehabilitation, the flaws of the justice system and the nature of power in all its forms.It is a study of human nature and friendship while its message of the importance of hope over fear is just as relevant now as when the story was written 34 years ago. \n",

      "The short novel by Stephen King has been adapted by Owen O'Neill and Dave Johns and is likely to prove popular with fans of the film as well as those who are too young to remember the original format. Based on the 1982 novella Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption, the play examines desperation, injustice, friendship and hope behind the bars of a maximum security facility. The 1994 feature film, regularly voted Britain's favourite ever movie, starred Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and was nominated for seven Academy Awards. Two of TV's best loved leading men, Ian Kelsey (Doctors, Casualty and Emmerdale) and Patrick Robinson (Casualty, Midsomer Murders), star in this new production of The Shawshank Redemption, which is running at Milton Keynes Theatre until Saturday. Despite protests of his innocence, Andy Dufresne is handed a double life sentence for the brutal murder of his wife and her lover. Incarcerated at the notorious Shawshank facility, he quickly learns that no one can survive alone. Andy strikes up an unlikely friendship with the prison fixer Red, and things take a slight turn for the better. However, when Warden Stammas decides to bully Andy into subservience and exploit his talents for accountancy, a desperate plan is quietly hatched. A minimalist set is the perfect backdrop as the story unfolds in the confines of the prison walls. Dim lighting with the sound of doors slamming and keys turning makes you feel as though you were inside the 'Shank' with the inmates. The onstage partnership of Kelsey and Robinson has a genuine warmth to it, and this is complimented by their co-stars who bring both light and shade to the performance. No one can miss the distinctive laugh of Rooster, wonderfully but hauntingly captured by Leigh Jones, and Ian Barritt as Brooksie and George Evans as Tommy Williams shine in their 'darkest' moments. Owen O'Neill is perfect for the role of Warden Stammas, chillingly bringing a sense of fear to the stage every time he features. With the film's cult status, some die-hard fans may not like the fast-pace of the stage adaptation, which takes you through the years inside at a much quicker pace than the original film. But there is no harm in breathing new life into a classic and if you loved the film, why not indulge yourself in re-living it in a new format. The show contains strong language and adult content and is recommended for people aged 15 and over. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman A man who plans his escape for 18 years and the only guilty man (Freeman) watches him all along but never comes to know about his plans. 18 years in confinement and still remaining sane is the true definition of someone who calls himself a life loving person. .. His struggle throughout the prison on dealing with inmates and warden and all the other things is depicted in a very surreal fashion.

The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it.

I saw it on Netflix when I got it and had been meaning to watch it whenever I saw it but did not get round to it as I didn't have the time. Well today I decided that I would sit down and watch it. The Shawshank Redemption definitely deserves the top spot that it has on IMDb! What a brilliant, amazing, damn near perfect film! There is not a single bad thing I can say about The Shawshank Redemption. The acting is perfect, the cinematography is great, the story is perfect as is the pacing - a 2 and a half hour movie that never once gets boring but doesn't move too quickly. The movie is full of characters that you like, even though they are all convicted murderers (well all accept Andy) and the people that you are supposed to hate, you do hate. But not because the movie tells you to hate these people but because of all the things that you see them do. Being someone who has grown up many years after this film has come out, it's great to see all the effects that films like this have had on modern cinema and then when you watch the film that caused all the movies that you have grown up watching.

It seems only fitting that it be for the tied, greatest film I've ever seen. The Shawshank Redemption in its 142 minute run time, spanning 20 years of the lives of friends, Red and Andy, this masterpiece draws us in more and more as each act and scene passes that by the end we as an audience have no alternative but to praise the journey of emotion we've been on while watching it. This master class motion picture, equipped with not only some of the finest directing (Frank Darabont) and Cinematography (Roger Deakins) we've ever been treated to as an audience, but one of the greatest film scores (Thomas Newman) ever composed and in my opinion, the most excellently written and simply beautiful story in a film since the inception of the motion picture written by the one and only Stephen King.I can not give enough praise to this film, it was every thing I look for in a film and so much more.

      "The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen.Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW.

Few more cons would be stated , but I'd go with the pros : A movie that beats all expectations, so is the plot, and so does it, because whenever you see a scene , you expect something, but it goes otherwise.The ending is really good, few movies manage to strike the bullseye when it comes to endings.

Therefore instead of a review, I'll give a statement regarding this film: This is one of the few times where a film's success, it's overall feeling and merits, surpasses that of the book (or in this case story), and in stating this, there should be no decrement to what Stephen King wrote. In regards to books being made into films, I feel that each version (film and story) itself enhances the other, and each should not be compared or critiqued for what is lacking, or plentiful. Instead, they should each be looked upon as a separate entity, with each 'form' evoking our emotions in their own unique and separate way!In order to make these statements, I have to say that I have read the Stephen King short story (or novella), \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\". I have also listened to the audio-book, and all three inspire, give hope and yes even define the word 'Redemption', in their own unique ways.One might not be able to fairly compare an apple's flavour, to that of an orange, but you certainly can compare a Granny Smith to a Red Delicious.

Yet, regardless of this fact, it is a life changer; true awe inspired amazing film, it explores the true meaning of being a human and, beyond that the truth behind friendship. This is \"The Shawshank Redemption\". In a nutshell, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is the story of Mr. Andy Dufresne and his journey to reach the films title: redemption. A man accused of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences. He is shipped to Shawkshank Prison, in Maine, to spend the rest of his life. Over the next 10-20-30 years, he finds his way to peace, truth and holds onto great hope in the midst of the terror of the prison system.The performances in the film is top notch. Andy is played perfectly by Mr. Tim Robbins. The true hero in this piece is \"Red\" by the one and the only Morgan Freeman. He narrates the film and shows the development of each character, and above all characters he changes the most. Considering he is one of the oldest characters, he contradicts the old saying of \"you cannot teach a old dog new tricks\". Change is always possible, to those that are willing and hold on to hope. Another character that is beautifully painted is that of Brooks, who has been in the prison the longest and has really known nothing else. He has become \"institutionalized\", and has intern lost hope for the future and his life.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is one of those films that is a true work of both art and magic. It is a perfectly painted picture of a man who will not reliquish the only thing someone cannot directly take away: hope. From first shot of Shawshank prison - an utterly Gothic structure that permeates you with a sense of just how frightening the prison will be - you are enveloped inside of the world of Shawshank. You experience a prison life composed of routine after routine after routine after routine.The remarkable staying power of this film is visible with every new shot in the film. It is able to sustain itself throughout its duration and to keep you enraptured with its remarkable hopeful story.It seems important to write this review now, in a low point of my life, and watching the movie (quiet a few times) I have realized new and important points of the film. It has uplifted me and gave me hope, however in different ways then it did when I first saw it in early 2000's.In the end, this is one of those movies that need to be seen by all.\"Remember Red, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\" \n",

      "Stephen King's books have a distinctive voice - warm, sincere, inviting - that probably accounts for the appeal of his fiction just as much as his macabre imagination.Yet none of the many movies adapted from King's work have managed to capture his singular, light, immediately recognizable tone.Until now, that is: \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" a first feature written and directed by Frank Darabont, finds the perfect cinematic equivalent to King's style. Based on the nonhorror novella \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,\" this is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature.Like much of King's work, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is about an exceptional individual at odds with society, picked on or persecuted for the gifts that set him apart. In this case, the gift isn't supernatural, like Carrie's telekinetic powers, but moral and spiritual.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a gangly young banker when he enters Maine's fortresslike Shawshank State Prison in 1946, accused of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover. Though his protestations of innocence don't carry much weight, his shy manner and decency does. Befriended by Red (Morgan Freeman), a veteran con who is the prison fixer, he soon draws a circle of other boyishly likable prisoners around him, including William Sadler as a sweet-tempered thug and James Whitmore as a cuddly old man who is the prison librarian.Like \"Forrest Gump,\" to which \"Shawshank\" bears a coincidental but commercially convenient resemblance, this is a story of saintly endurance. Though Andy is abused by a prison bully who rapes him, a brutal guard who beats him and a crafty warden who uses Andy's banking skills to launder the vast amounts of cash he's siphoning off the system, Andy's patience, tolerance and selfless concern for his fellow man see him through.The poster girl on his cell wall turns from Rita Hayworth to Marilyn Monroe to Raquel Welch, before providence rewards him with an opportunity to get some of his own back.Those poster girls remain pretty much the only female presence in this snug, all-male environment, where the warm camaraderie suggests less a prison than a boys' club on an epic scale. So sweetly juvenile is the film's perspective that it comes as a shock to realize, in the final act, that King's story is at heart an elaborate revenge fantasy.In a film that stands or falls on the central character's amiability, Tim Robbins is loose and effective, though the real performance here is from Morgan Freeman, whose projected affection for his friend really determines how we feel about him. Darabont's direction is precise and assured, without being terribly imaginative. \n",

So I doubt if Castle Rock, or Columbia or anyone involved in making it, got a single cent?So I started with disc 3, boring pseudo-interviews with the main actors. Didn't learn much there, and the \"behind the scenes\" clip was only 9 minutes and not very informative, so, to disc 2 and eventually watched the actual film. By now I'm a bit overloaded with superlatives. But then thought about the tiny flaws, ie, Robbins as the main character Andy. Insipid, unconvincing? maybe, doesn't come across as either an innocent inmate, nor as a super clever. Norton the warden looks and sounds more like a small-town bank manager and acts like a modern big city corrupt banker? Hadley, the awful captain of the guard looks more like a \"upwardly mobile professional\"?The other inmates are forgettable (except Brooks, the OLD guy). The \"get busy living or get busy dying\" scene confuses me, that is what I call a \"sillyism\". It means whatever you want it to mean.I note that there is almost zero female participation? Well, it's a jail story of course, not much room for skirts. On my rating system, I gave it a 1 out 2 for the story, 1.5 out of 2 for the character definitions, 1.5 out 2 for the acting (Freeman is great of course), 2 for the filming, I kept noticing the colours and contrasts even in the dull setting, and only 1 more for the directing and production. 0 for special scenes! then 1 more for the dvds!disc 1 also has a commentary by Frank Darabont, which didn't really add much. But he does comment on the question of how the poster got put back up after the escape! \"Get over it, it's movie\" True. His chapter in the booklet told everything, including why various scenes had not been shot \"mutatis mutandis\" (look it up!) \n",

There are many problems which we don't want to recognize it is true in prison. This movie shows that there are a lot of people manage to live in such a terrible place. All People have different life, and all people live desperately and all people will die someday. The way to live is different like the life.

      "The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films that the majority of people will love, and yet, it can be hard to pinpoint one particular reason why. The performances are stellar, in fact it's hard to think of any particular cast member who lets the team down, but that's not it. The set design is suitably bleak, the dialogue is just the right balance of realism and poetry, and we once again get to hear the dulcet tones of Morgan Freeman's narration, but again, these are not what make the film great. Everything comes together with Shawshank, creating an instant and intense atmosphere that can be gritty, distressing, and at the same time, hopeful, humorous and beautiful. This film portrays the character's life and experience with frank honesty, with the undeniable quality of the production only serving to support this incredible story. Even the score is impressive, adding tension even when you don't even notice it's there. The only reason I don't give this film a ten is because it is not usually a genre that I love, and although this film is definitely an exception, I cannot say it is outright perfect. But it's damn near close! \n",

If one were to quickly google \"Top 100 Movies of All Time\", I can guarantee this movie will be on that list. However, is this movie worth the recognition and critical acclaim? The short answer is: yes. Of course. THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION takes the qualities of a standard film and ups the game drastically. Loving characters? Check. Well-shot iconic scenes? Yep, it also has that. An unforgettable quirky narrative? You betcha. Now, given my rating of a 9, I obviously did not find this movie to be a somewhat modern masterpiece. (This calls for a re-watch so I can reform or reinforce my views) However, is it irrational to call this the best movie of the 90s? No, it's actually completely understandable. Is it irrational to call this the best movie of all time?

      "//////SPOILERS INCLUDED////////// Before I begin this review I would like to state my age and the date. I am 16 years old and today's date is July 16th 2016. I know thousands of reviews have been written regarding this movie but I doubt many have been wrote through the eyes and mind of a teenager. This film was originally recommended to me by my uncle when I was the age of 14, at the time I shunned the offer. 2 years later I have sat down to watch this film and I can comfortably say it was one of the best decisions I've made. The movie begins with an innocent banker Andy Dufrene (Tom Robbins) being sentenced to Shawshank prison for the murder of his wife. He soon is introduced to the trusty Red (Morgan Freeman), their friendship blossoms and this adds to the raw cinematography. I can honestly say from the eyes of naive teenager this is one of, if not the best films I have seen. It stems along side another Stephen King classic, Stand by me. The Shawshank Redemption is often critiqued along side The Godfarther to determine which is the greatest. But personally I believe The Godfarther should put it's success down to the director Francis Coppola and main actor Marlon Brando, without them the movie would not be the same. Shawshank is genuine and delivers morals with a great perspective on life, that being friendship and loyalty is more important than greed and success. It's very rare to find a film that really hits you and makes you actually contemplate what should be a priority and that is why I believe The Shawshank Redemtion is greatest film ever made. Frank Darabont - job well done! \n",

This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.

The lessons this movie teaches will help you every now and then in real life. \"Some birds aren't meant to be caged\" will destroy the limits you had set for yourself in your mind. This movie is my ultimate weapon to get out of depression and hard times. \"Every man has a breaking point\" but this quote when followed by \"Hope is a good thing\" makes sense. That's the simplicity of the movie. \n",

There were parts in the movie that I felt like I knew how the emotions of the characters actually felt. Needless to say I believed them. I find it hard to watch movies where I don't believe the characters in the movie. But these guys really did their job. Of course I usually find myself enjoying the roles that Morgan Freeman plays. He's got a great knack for this sort of stuff. I was really glad that I watched this one and will watch it many more times in the future. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a poignant story about hope. Beautiful, moving and painful, it's a hard mix to get right, but this film has it all.The plot itself is nothing new, in fact I would even go as far to say as it's average. But there is something about this film that vibrates the soul and moves your heart.Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, was sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit, but he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him sane; it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live.I keep revisiting this film every couple of years and every time I watch it, it feels like i'm watching it for the first time.

      "Movie starts with the main character falsely accused and sent to a high security prison to carry out the life sentence. Directed gracefully drives his plot through Andy and it is well supported by Red's character as well. Oh my god, who doesn't love Morgan Freeman's voice. It's magical and one of the many reasons that keeps us aligned with the story-line.Not the kind of a movie that would make you laugh and clap while you're at the theaters or when you're watching on Netflix but it definitely is one of a kind which comes back to your memory at times and fixes your thinking pattern. Kind of a movie that proves, story- line is always the VIP of the movie. Each and every conversation between Andy and Red are splendid. Especially the last conversation between these two goes to another level. The words still do a dance in the memory.Prison doesn't scare a man to death but it does steal the whole life from him and make him wish that he shouldn't have done what he had done. The experience of a person who spends more time in prison than the outside world has been very well used to create the idea of how a prison treats the man and how it changes or rather cultivates him better. Let it be Red or let it be Brooks, the portrayal through those characters on the mentioned subject is extra ordinary.Determination and perseverance shown through Andy is flawless. He is a man of hope, a hope that lights its own flames to guide us through the scary dark places of life.To conclude, it is a kind of movie that everyone should watch at least once in their life time.In one word: \"Sublime\" \n",

Looking back at the 1994 Oscars, in my opinion i think it should have won Best Picture over Forest Gump. Honestly, i don't think there is a single flaw in this movie.

Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance.One of the most touching moments in \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a scene in which an elderly convict, who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up, is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories.The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect movie \n",

      "All I can say is that some people have to do their research. This film is absolutely backwards and does not reflect reality. It was clearly written by someone who has no idea how the prison system works.The protagonist of this film, played drearily by the effortlessly dumb-founded Tim Robbins, is a white man. Not only this, many of his strangely old convict buddies are white. He is even raped by a white man who he attempts to deter with a mop; he's not a puddle Robbins, you bloody idiot!What the filmmakers clearly don't understand is that in reality, all prisoners are black and I'm NOT being racist, these are just facts. It's not because they commit more crimes, it is purely white privilege gone mad as no-one will accept them into their prisons and it is truly saddening to see so much money spunked out on another film attempting to hide this institutionalised love of these creamy coloured pussies.This is just another film in a long line of prison propaganda trying to brainwash us into thinking that white people commit crimes. Take Cool Hand Luke for example: as if anyone would convict Paul Newman. No! They'd be too busy trying to dive head first into his slacks to get a suckle of his lean member.At least Morgan Freeman is in the film, an allusion to the reality that Frank Darabont will not recognise for fear of being ostracised by the White High Council.Unfortunately, this is not enough to salvage this film and so I can only give it 2 stars out of 10. One for each true fact portrayed in the film. One, that there are black people in prisons and, two, that Tim Robbins would totally get raped in prison.THIS IS ALL A JOKE. THANK YOU FOR READING. \n",

You WILL NOT be disappointed by this, even with the seemingly excessive hype that surrounds it now, decades later. Everything is there...everything. Calling it 'perfect in every way' makes one just seem like a biased fanboy bereft of any objectivity, but really, on a number of levels, everything you will come to expect of brilliant, masterful cinema, you will find here. Its cinematography, plain but efficient; its length, just right, not one scene too long or too many. The acting, superb all-round, and the characters as vivid and efficient/relevant to the story as possible. The tension in the film: just right. We're always given compelling events to deal with, some rough and tragic, that just deepen the film more and more, while creating subplots and rejuvenating the story with newer elements, but while never straying away from the whole point of the film, which is, ladies and gentlemen, so touching and unique I'd have great difficulty to find a climax as beautifully directed, imagined and executed, and as magically cultivated scene after scene, until this utmost emotional eruption. The dialog, Freeman's narration, the complexity on so many levels and the layers of the plot, the theme of good vs evil, of never giving up, the thirst for justice, the intelligence manifested through the main character...

The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely?

      "An amazing heart warming film that displays human connection, emotion and friendship. One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The story is such a simple yet powerful embellishment of the human nature, the value of human interaction in a prison facility and the notion of time or rather the use of time in said prison. This film is so heartwarming. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. If you haven't seen this movie, go grab it now. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. A must watch! \n",

      "We've been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We've seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that's been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it's the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale's Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox's inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling.As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It's not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker's stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could've pulled something like this off. That's how difficult of a role this was, and that's why Ledger's performance is so great.This isn't an action movie. It's a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it's all in there. \n",

      "In 1947 Portland, Maine, Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy is befriended by contraband smuggler, Ellis \"Red\" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer and later a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly assaulted by \"the Sisters\" and their leader, Bogs.In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance, and offers to help him legally shelter the money. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is then transferred to another prison. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the Warden begins using Andy to handle matters for a variety of people, including guards from other prisons and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters asking the state government for funds to improve the decaying library.In 1954, Brooks is paroled, but cannot adjust to the outside world after fifty years in prison, and commits suicide by hanging himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in him receiving solitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains that hope is what gets him through his time, a concept that Red dismisses. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. He has Andy launder the money using the alias Randall Stephens.In 1965, Tommy Williams is incarcerated for burglary. He is befriended by Andy and Red, and Andy helps him pass his GED exam. In 1966, Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for the murders for which Andy was convicted. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but he refuses to listen and sends Andy back to solitary confinement when he mentions the money laundering. Norton has Hadley murder Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy declines to continue the laundering, but relents after Norton threatens to burn the library, remove Andy's protection from the guards, and move him to worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months, and tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican coastal town. Red feels Andy is being unrealistic, but promises Andy that if he is ever released, he will visit a specific hayfield near Buxton, Maine, and retrieve a package Andy buried there. He worries about Andy's wellbeing, especially when he learns Andy asked another inmate to supply him with six feet (1.8 meters) of rope.The next day at roll call, the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the last 19 years. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, using the rope to bring with him Norton's suit, shoes, and the ledger containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens and visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money, then mails the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. FBI agents arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide by shooting himself to avoid his arrest.After serving forty years, Red is finally paroled. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited. \n",

Every dialog is a gem.This movie has not have a single unnecessary line.Morgan Freeman's VO is fantastic. There is so much good about this movie that words aren't enough to explain that.If you haven't see then go watch now. Deserves to be No.1 on IMDb's top 250 films list.

One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate.

      "\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair. It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope. \n",

But after watching fat ass gets beaten up and the conflicts by Bogs on Andy, I got acknowledged that a prisoner have to experience such a harsh life in a prison as Andy which was shown perfectly by the director. I think that Red character gives the movie not only the narration but also makes it really interesting as Morgan Freeman has got involved in his character very deeply.What makes me give this movie '10' is not that tremendous,shocking,19 year patience and hard work escape by Andy.Though it was by Andy, when he took a favor(promise) from Red to make him realize that hope is always a good thing to have and it wont die.Off course a lovely ending also made me give this movie '10'.After all what I can say about this movie is it was an excellent film with much more excellency in story. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is presently the highest rated movie on IMDb. It follows a man who is wrongly accused of murder and sent to prison for multiple years because of it. The prison, Shawshank, is a prison which acts outside of the law and ends up being very brutal because of it. For the most part it's pretty deserving of its rating, but it's definitely not the best movie ever made in my opinion. The plot of this movie is pretty great. It's interesting and somewhat unique, and it actually throws you off a little. It's a movie that isn't horribly plot-driven, but nonetheless is very interesting. The characters are the driving force of the movie, and they were very good. They all feel pretty realistic, and the actors are all fantastic.Overall The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie. While I wouldn't call it the best movie ever, or even put it close to that place, it's a very well-made movie that I enjoyed quite a lot. There isn't a lot I can really say about it. Everything about this movie is great, and if I were to go any deeper I'd probably end up spoiling something. In the end I'd recommend this movie to pretty much anyone. It's a movie that you should just watch and see what you think for yourself. \n",

But it's nothing it not a shining example of the power of the indomitable human spirit. You root for Andy Dufresne from the very beginning as a man unfairly targeted by fate, and you want desperately for him to succeed . . . somehow. Mixed in with all of this is a well-written story about friendship, and even a little bit of revenge to sweeten the deal. As a Stephen King story, it's a classic, and a faithful screen adaptation.And that cast is impeccable.9/10 \n",

      "Stephen King's books have a distinctive voice - warm, sincere, inviting - that probably accounts for the appeal of his fiction just as much as his macabre imagination.Yet none of the many movies adapted from King's work have managed to capture his singular, light, immediately recognizable tone.Until now, that is: \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" a first feature written and directed by Frank Darabont, finds the perfect cinematic equivalent to King's style. Based on the nonhorror novella \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,\" this is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature.Like much of King's work, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is about an exceptional individual at odds with society, picked on or persecuted for the gifts that set him apart. In this case, the gift isn't supernatural, like Carrie's telekinetic powers, but moral and spiritual.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a gangly young banker when he enters Maine's fortresslike Shawshank State Prison in 1946, accused of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover. Though his protestations of innocence don't carry much weight, his shy manner and decency does. Befriended by Red (Morgan Freeman), a veteran con who is the prison fixer, he soon draws a circle of other boyishly likable prisoners around him, including William Sadler as a sweet- tempered thug and James Whitmore as a cuddly old man who is the prison librarian. \n",

No bad acting, no weird camera shots, no mistakes (as far as i know) but maybe I will watch it again and re-edit my review accordingly. Maybe I missed something? Or maybe it really IS flawless?

The film version to King's novel has been out for several years now, and yet I still find myself enjoying it just I did when it first premiered in theaters. I am not one to spoil an experience by mentioning specific scenes, so I will just say that if you are a Stephen King admirer, as I am, you will love this film!

      "Last week some news came out from somebody online who had claimed to have seen a finished version of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. If you were like me, you've been leery of checking it out because you weren't sure how much might actually be true. Now Zack Snyder has spoken out about the spoiler-filled post, although his response doesn't really clear anything up.In a word, to MTV, he called the post \"hilarious,\" which might imply that he's saying that it's mostly, if not entirely, untrue. That might be the case, but then again he could have just said it was untrue and he didn't say that. What he did say, however, is that he doesn't like spoilers. While this may seem odd for the director who's most recent trailer appeared to give away the entire movie, Snyder says that's not the case. Even if you've seen the trailer, you can rest easy, as there is much more we have not seen in then finished film. Says Snyder: I have the benefit of seeing the movie. It's cool that fans think it's too much, and I appreciate people not wanting to know, but there's plenty that they don't know. There's a lot of movie that's not in the trailer.In the process of calling the Batman v Superman Reddit review hilarious, Snyder goes on to talk about how he hates it when spoilers come out. The director would much rather that fans see the movie mostly blind. While he understands that some fans may wish to find the answers before hand, he wants his movies to be mysteries going in. If you're, as an audience member, exploring these articles, looking for answers to questions that you have, maybe you're okay with knowing before you go. It's like an individual taste. But like I said, I want people to see the movie without knowing.Spoilers are a topic that mean different things to different people. While most try to avoid them to some degree, the need to solve the mystery is a nearly universal human experience. We have an inclination to want to know the truth, even while also wanting to be surprised. For most of us getting some information is good, but getting all the information is bad, of course, only getting the details that you want can be difficult. \n",

I am mocked by my friends for my taste for the dark (taxi driver, once upon a time in America, in the bedroom and the war zone just to name a few favorites) but this film is the only film I have ever seen (again, maybe Rocky) that has ever made me proud to be human. This is truly the role that has defined Morgan Freeman's career (has he really played a different character since?) and the subtleties of Andy Dufresne are endless. He is a stoic character but one of the most likable, most believable and most beloved in film. It is a film built on the little things for much of its two and a half hours, and there are so many beautiful little scenes. We learn to love these characters, when the are dragged through the mud so are we, and when they triumph we are every bit as elated. The world is a nasty and ugly place that will beat you down if you let it, so don't let it. Andy never lost hope. 'Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.'

His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job.

If a movie exists, I want to immediately give it a 5. A 5 seems very middle-of-the-road for me, and I want to give each film the benefit of the doubt. So, I automatically go into a film thinking it's a 5, and if it goes well or gets better as I watch it, that rating goes up. The rating goes down if I see more negative than positive aspects about the film.I explain my rating process to ensure to others that I do NOT hate this film.

It has been the pinnacle of many Top 10 lists since its release, and even IMDb here has it at the top of its Top 250. So, unless you have lived most of your life under a rock, you are fully aware of the attention and praise this film has gathered since 1994. Do not - I repeat, do NOT - go into the film expecting great things. If you can watch the movie without any preconceived opinions, that would be the best. You might thoroughly enjoy Shawshank. Going down the checklist, the movie has just about everything you need for a great film: Theme: It's got \"redemption\" in the title, everyone. I think you can figure it out, but the film also touches on forgiveness, endurance, and friendship - all good themes to explore in film Acting: Morgan Freeman is amazing, as always. Tim Robbins is loved by critics (I've never particularly cared for him), and does a decent job of conveying a full spectrum of emotions Source Material: It's based on a Stephen King short story. Stephen King has been cinema gold, as far as I can tell. The Shining, Stand By Me, and The Green Mile have all been successful It all sounds so good, right? Well, I would definitely tell you to watch this film, as I think most films should be given a chance, especially modern classics such as this one. However, I would not believe all the hype.For me, it was an average film with major expectations, and ultimately, I was let down.

Although the main value or 'thing' that this movie promotes is hope, it has lots and lots of other things hidden inside it like humanity, sympathy, addiction and 'institutionalization'. It can be viewed by every other individual in his/her own perspective and be be appreciated in numerous ways. One can always find a new way to cherish it after every view. The acting by everyone is just beyond description. You may forget for a moment that they are actors. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's performance just phenomenal and completely sucked us in like they were our close ones. In the end, I just want to say that this is a masterpiece and I doubt whether another like this will be created in a long time to come. In my opinion, filmmakers should go back to the origin of Art which is for pleasure and relaxation of mind and soul and stop wasting money on high-budget action flicks which are worthless(I am not saying all) and make films like this one which are a delight to watch and a lot to learn from. \n",

This movie has so more than one story going on and it needs a real good observation to understand all the aspects. If you can watch it with film critics, watch it as they will add a new angle to watching the movie. After watching try to add some of the aspects of the movie to your life as this movie teaches us many lessons of life.It also shows to us that how harsh prison life can be and a person needs to be mentally strong to handle himself in the jail.He must also make friends in jail as they can help him. \n",

      "Tied for the best movie I have ever seenWhy do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul. \n",

      "The story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest bus load of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a \"prison drama\" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word \"redemption\" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. \n",

      "While my utmost respect is given to all the current box-office hits my loyalty truly lies before my time. In 1994 Frank Darabont brought to life Stephen Kings genius story line and gave us the best film created to date. Shawshank Repdeption tells us the story of Andy Dufrene (Tom Robbins) who is sentenced to life in prison for two murders that he did not commit. For 19 years Andy learns how to live in the harsh conditions of Shawshank prison and even attracts the attention of many fellow inmates, a soon to be dear friend, Red (Morgan Freeman), and the warden who eventually entrusts Andy to assist him in his legal work. While the roll of Andy was originally turned by many big wigs including Tom Hanks and Brad Pitt because of other movie conflictions the universe eventually did Darabont a favor by landing Tom Robbins in the role. Robbins plays the seemly quiet, unforeseen mastermind of Andy Dufrene brilliantly. His lack of and delicately placed facial variations toys with the audience's emotions and somehow brings you to love the strange, shy convict. Perhaps the key element to Toms performance was not his own actions but reactions to the people around him. As a man of little words Robbins used his silence and expressions to rule his performance in a rare and powerful way.No surprise is the also incredible performance of Morgan Freeman who plays Red, Andy's best friend in the prison, and also the films narrator. Red had been at Shawshank long before Andy arrived and tells his story to us, the audience, after his dear friend, Andy, is gone. Before Andy came into the picture Red had already taken on the role of a low-profile leadership role in the prison and its obvious he is comfortable behind the walls of Shawshank. However, Andy didn't come alone, he brought with a sense a hope that we see spread within the inmates in particularly, Red. Morgan perfectly embodies his new sense of hope so the audience can watch it unfold in him. Even in a prison uniform he still steals the hearts of the audience members and has us all routing for him in his journey of looking at his life in a new way. Freeman also nails his performance as films narrator. He specking with that sense of hope Andy clearly left him with, but also somehow makes us miss Andy, the way you can sense that he does. Using his calm yet inspiring voice Red highlights the overall message and leaves the audience feeling ready to take on the world. The actor's incredible performances make this film what is it, but I would argue more than that, is the plot. Originally a Stephen King novel shawshank is undoubtabley the best written screenplay to date. Every intricate detail from prop placement to little character lines comes together in the end and forms a story like we have never seen before. The complexity is at the perfect balance where you aren't lost but you are always curious. Shawshank is a movie that you have to watch through and be constantly involved but naturally you are so intrigued that it is not hard to do. Shawshank Redemption is packed full of brilliant characters and well thought out moments. However, in making the wise decision to watch this film you are getting so much more than the entertainment of a incredible film. Frank Darabont uses Morgan Freemans ending monologue to leave you pondering life in a new way and eager to live out the famous words of Andy Dufrese, \"Get busy living, or get busy dying.\" \n",

I understand it might touch many peoples feelings, but the movie feels like it is just too clearly designed to evoke those feelings. It is a movie that takes ones hand and tells the viewer a clearly defined, well structured story that follows all the standard story beats one would expect from a prison drama. The fact that this movie has gotten so much praise just goes to show that Hollywood got all the rules of filmmaking figured out. This movie followed those rules to the letter and got tremendous success because of that. In short, the movie succeeds in what it aimed to do. Evoke symphaty where symphaty's due and evoke anger where anger is due. It helps that its very well made and edited. My gripe with this film is that it didn't do anything new.

      "There are standard ways to stage a prison film and standard ways to tell a story by Stephen King. But \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" based on a King novella and set in the correctional institution of the title, succeeds in avoiding the familiar.Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank Darabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care.There are times when \"The Shawshank Redemption\" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those \"triumph of the human spirit\" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cellblock. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two.When Andy is convicted of his wife's murder, the judge pronounces him \"a particularly remorseless and icy man.\" He sustains that chill when he first arrives at Shawshank, remaining aloof from other inmates even when those inmates threaten him with physical harm. \"I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight,\" says Red, who knows Andy has been gang-raped by fellow prisoners, in one of the film's only halfway-brutal episodes. \"I wish I could tell you that, but prison is no fairy-tale world.\" Needless to say, the heroes of such stories usually do succeed in defending themselves, at least when Hollywood is telling the fairy tale. But \"The Shawshank Redemption\" has its own brand of iconoclasm, with Mr. Darabont's direction as quiet, purposeful and secretive as Andy is himself.Eventually Andy begins to fit in, especially after he wows the guards with skills left over from his pre-prison banking career. From the first time he advises one guard to make a one-time-only tax-free gift to his wife, Andy gets a new lease on life as \"a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.\" Andy does special fiscal favors for the warden. (\"You know, the funny thing is, on the outside I was an honest man, straight as an arrow,\" he says about this. \"I had to come to prison to be a crook.\") He also makes the occasional dramatic gesture, like commandeering the prison's loudspeaker and playing a Mozart aria for all his fellow inmates. The film has a tendency to wax romantic at such moments, but more often it sustains an intelligent reserve.Mr. Freeman is so quietly impressive here that there's reason to wish Red's role had more range. As written, he spends his time observing Andy fondly and describing prison life. But Mr. Freeman's commanding presence makes him a much stronger figure than that. Mr. Freeman is especially moving when he suggests how dependent Red has become on the prison walls that give shape to his life. Even so, Red has kept his ruefulness. \"Only guilty man in Shawshank,\" he jokes about himself.Mr. Robbins has the trickier role of someone whose still waters run deep, but whose experience doesn't add up until an exposition-packed denouement. (The film's swift, enjoyably far-fetched closing scenes are a sharp reminder of who is the author of this story, after all.) Andy's is the more subdued role, but Mr. Robbins plays it intensely, and he ages effectively from newcomer to father figure during the story. One of Andy's projects is improving the prison library, which once contained nothing but the equivalent of books by Stephen King.To raise funds for this undertaking, Andy is steady and patient, writing weekly letters to state officials until he gets what he wants. Mr. Darabont, a screenwriter making an impressive directorial debut, works in much the same quietly persistent way. \"The Shawshank Conspiracy\" takes shape slowly and carefully, displaying an overall subtlety that's surprising in a movie of this genre. In the end, like Andy and Red, it gets to where it wanted to go.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and occasional violence, including a scene that discreetly suggests homosexual rape.THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION Written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the novella \"Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,\" by Stephen King; director of photography, Roger Deakins; edited by Richard Francis-Bruce; music by Tom Newman; production designer, Terence Marsh; produced by Niki Marvin; released by Columbia Pictures.

The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul. \n",

      "If there ever has been a list of movie that you can watch for unlimited number of times.... and have the same level of enjoyment and thrill, this movie easily will top that list.The classic story plot revolving around a jail inmate who probably didn't commit the crime and various stages of emotional levels that a person experiences while in jail. The best thing about this movie is the calm posture of the main lead under all circumstances. He has done proper justice to his character and has delivered an excellent performance. Morgan freeman on the other hand have supported the main lead up to the fullest. His face expressions were so real that as if he is actually there. The other cast has also done justice to their characters. The music in the entire movie is so smooth that you won't even notice it. But the best thing in the whole package it the script. I wonder which script will surpass the excellence of shawshank redemption. On the whole, the best movie that you will ever watch (till to date) . I recommend movie viewers to keep a copy of this in their library and whenever you feel low or need motivation, turn this movie on yo squeeze the lemons of life. \n",

      "\"The Shawshank Redemption\" starts off with the familiar brutality of a prison movie. Convicted in the late 1940s for the murder of his wife and her lover, banker Tim Robbins is thrown into the slammer (the Shawshank penitentiary in Maine) for two consecutive life sentences.Seasoned inmate Morgan Freemanthe narrator in this storywatches as the soft-spoken, vulnerable prisoner undergoes the inevitable gang rape. Prison, Freeman tells the audience in that inimitably authoritative voice, \"is no fairy tale world.\"In this case, he's dead wrong. \" Shawshank, \" based on Stephen King's novella \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,\" is a complete fairy tale, a sentimental yarn full of the darndest twists and turns since Frank Capra rolled his cameras. Cinematographer Roger Deakins's images are burnished with that \"long time ago\" golden glow, the inmates areultimatelya bunch of cute pushovers, and the worst thing about prison (give or take an initiation rape or three) is the boredom.\"In prison,\" intones Freeman, \"a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied.\" What Robbins, who has proclaimed his innocence all along, does to keep his mind occupied is the punch line of the story.The institution is run by warden Bob Gunton, a clichéd sociopathic despot who likes beating prisoners to death (to make a point) but will not abide religious blasphemy. Gunton is enthusiastically supported by sadistic guard Clancy Brown, who enjoys a regular round of assault and battery himself.But it's clear from the start that Robbins, despite the hardships, is emotionally protected by his own innocence. He charms everyone and, eventually, parlays his business skills into a useful commodity. By the end, these grim authoritarians and jailbirds are eating out of his hand. In fact, Robbins's effect on everyone is so cheesily messianic, they should have called this \"Forrest Gump Goes to Jail.\"Speaking of jail, \"Shawshank\"-the-movie seems to last about half a life sentence. The story, chiefly about the 20-year friendship between Freeman and Robbins, becomes incarcerated in its own labyrinthine sentimentality. It wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on the aforementioned finale. And leave it to pandering, first-time director Frank Darabont to ensure no audience member leaves this film unsure of the ending. Heaven forbid a movie should end with a smidgen of mystery!Still, although \"Shawshank\" gradually deteriorates (or, if you're a sentimentalist, gets better and better), there are things to be enjoyed. The principal performances are the most obvious pleasures. Robbins with those bulging baby blues and that voluptuous baby mouthexudes the perfect kind of innocence to sell this tall tale.As for Freeman, he's a master of comedic and poignant cadence. He could read the local real estate listings and make you weepor laugh. \"These walls are funny,\" he intones. \"First you hate them. Then you get used to them. After time passes, you get so's you depend on them.\" From Freeman, these words read like existential thunder.When Robbins, upon making Freeman's acquaintance, asserts that he's innocent of the double murder, Freeman smirks. \"You're going to fit right in,\" he tells Robbins. \"You know that everybody in here's innocent?\" \n",

      "Few things you certainly know about 'The Shawshank Redemption': it was nominated for 7 Oscars, yet failed to win any, it failed at the box office and it is probably the best movie ever made.I felt mesmerized watching this movie, and I believe everyone who has watched it must have felt the same. A perfect adaptation of Stephen King's novel 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption', this movie stays faithful to the plot of the novella with very minor alterations. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have given stellar performances. Freeman's eloquent narration throughout the film provides the description of the events happening over the prison and his friendship with Andy Dufresne over a number of years from his character's perspective. The main themes of the movie, hope, self-worth, integrity and friendship are beautifully interlocked with the prison-drama. The climate of Shawshank State Penitentiary is painted gray and dull to amplify the intensity of every event. The depiction of institutionalized life and emotions of the prisoners, who aren't only trapped inside Shawshank physically but psychologically as well, are very precise. The character of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, displays extraordinary courage and self-worth in the hopeless walls of Shawshank prison. The climax is intricately woven with poetic justice. This film is Frank Darabont's Magnum Opus. A well deserved #1 on IMDb's Top 250. \n",

About 2 years after this acclaimed movie came out my family had an Exchange student from Caracas, Venezuela named Christian and he loved this movie so so much. We all watched this movie at least 222 times that year. It is hard to believe that The Shawshank Redemption has been out 21 or years and every time it is on TV all I can say in Morgan Freeman's illustrious voice is Poor Andy Dufrane. Just starting out in show business Shawshank Redemption is a great study piece in all aspects of filmaking.

      "Though the film is set in Maine, the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio, served as the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary. Although a large portion of the prison was torn down after filming, the main administration building and two cell blocks remained; the site was revisited for filming parts of the film Air Force One.[12] Several of the interior shots of the specialized prison facilities, such as the admittance rooms and the warden's office, were shot in the reformatory. [12] The interior of the boarding room used by Brooks and Red was located in the administration building, though exterior shots were made elsewhere.[12] The prison site is a tourist attraction.[12] Internal scenes in the prison cell blocks were actually filmed on a soundstage built inside the nearby shuttered Westinghouse factory.[12] Downtown scenes were also filmed in Mansfield, as well as neighboring Ashland, Ohio. The oak tree under which Andy buries his letter to Red is located at 40°39′14″N 82°23′31″W, near Malabar Farm State Park, in Lucas, Ohio. The tree was heavily damaged by straight-line winds in a thunderstorm on July 29, 2011; officials were unsure if the tree would survive.[13] However, due to rally groups and inspections by forestry organizations, the tree was found to be alive and well and still stands today.[14]Just as a prison in Ohio stood in for a fictional one in Maine, the beach scenes shown in the final minutes of the film meant to portray Zihuatanejo, Mexico, were actually shot in the Caribbean on the island of St. Croix, one of the U.S. Virgin Islands. The beach at 'Zihuatanejo' is Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge, a two-mile crescent of sand just south of Frederiksted on the southwestern tip of the island. The refuge is a hatching ground for leather back sea turtles, and open only at limited times (10 am to 4 pm on Saturdays and Sundays), and not at all during the breeding season.[15]The film was dedicated to Allen Greene, \n",

It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul. Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption will be the highest praised film by the general public for decades to come. It is very tough to dislike this film; perhaps there are some that find it overrated, but its message speaks to anybody who has a heart and soul.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) befriends Red (Morgan Freeman) shortly after he is convicted to serve two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover. He is somewhat of a mystery to Red since he does not seem like a murderer at all and goes out of his way to improve Shawshank prison by attempting to establish a better library in the prison by himself. He is better educated than most and his friends learn from him and follow him as if he was the Lord. Most importantly, he sticks to the idea of hope even after having a couple horrible years at the beginning of his sentence.Dufresne is a great character and role model for his friends, but the story's focus is on Red's reaction to Andy's actions and influence on the group. He becomes so close to Andy that he confesses his guilt to Andy in privacy as if Andy was a priest. This is a surprise to Andy since the inmates have a joke that \"everybody in Shawshank is innocent.\"These two stars are incredible in the film, though Freeman expresses a little more emotion than Robbins does. Robbins is essentially there to be a guide for his character's friends while Freeman is a voice of reason through learning from his experience in prison. He plays a character who is a little bit older than the rest (besides a character named Brooks) and who understands and fears the notion of becoming institutionalized.This story of friendship and hope is inspirational in countless ways. At several times it seems to implicate that characters will give up but at the last second they make a hard turn and decide to move on and persevere. This is a drama, so not everything which unfolds is happy, but the dreariness within the film makes the case for the power of hope that much stronger.There are so many memorable things about The Shawshank Redemption. It has phenomenal leading performances, brilliant music by Thomas Newman, its use of Mozart in relation to the setting of a prison is powerful, the interaction of the characters make for some memorable comedic bits to help us make it through the drama, and the list goes on and on. And even without these factors, the movie is superb at getting such an inspiring message across, and the ending maybe have you weeping with joy.Even though this is not the greatest movie ever made, this is the one film everybody must watch in their lifetime.

I can remember the first time i ever saw this movie, my now late mother showed it to me and told me that it was a really good movie.(this is when it came on HBO i think) i couldn't believe my eyes even at the age of 11 i was already into the best of movies, and when i watched the story unfold in front of me and witnessed the pure cinematography of it. It immediately became my favorite film of all time. And to this day, 17 years later i am a filmmaker myself and someday strive to make a movie half as good as the shawshank redemption. \n",

      "One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. Out of the three genre-defining classics released in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption was the one that ended up bearing the maximum brunt. First commercially by failing to recover its budget for it debuted in theatres together with one of cinema's greatest watershed events; Pulp Fiction. And then at Academy Awards where it was nominated for seven Oscars yet failed to win any, thanks to the sweeping show by the critics' darling, Forrest Gump.But life ever since has been very kind to this film, and both critics & viewers have embraced its uplifting story of hope & friendship with remarkable amount of respect, love & kindness. Today, The Shawshank Redemption enjoys a position that's arguably even higher than the two classics which eclipsed it back in 1994 and while it was discarded at its time of release, it is now rightly & universally acknowledged as one of the greatest films of all time.The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife & her illicit lover and is ultimately sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison where his coping with the brutal hardships of confined life slowly earns him the respect of his fellow inmates & prison staff, including that of \"Red\" in whom Andy finds a trusted ally. The remainder of the film explores their friendship over the next two decades.Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption that'll manage to connect deeply with most of us in one way or another plus it also marks Darabont's directional debut and he couldn't have asked for a better start. All this film has is men in either prison or police uniforms talking to one another over the course of its runtime and yet it never looked dull or felt like dragging at any given moment.Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison and provides considerable depth & realism to the era this film is set in. Every moment of despair has a shadowy appearance while moments of hope gleam with light. Editing is spectacular too as the gradual progression of Andy's life, his friendship with Red, and his determination to not give in to the four walls containing him is effectively unfolded. And Thomas Newman's score beautifully blends with the film's tone & characters' lives, and is emotionally fulfilling.Coming to the performances, Tim Robbins delivers a swashbuckling performance as Andy Dufresne, the banker wrongfully convicted for the crime he didn't commit. And if Robbins is at his best, then Morgan Freeman is even better as Red, Andy's friend who is also serving a life sentence & is notorious amongst the inmates for he can smuggle goods into the prison. Freeman also narrates the story to us at which he does an even better job. His work is grounded & can go easily unnoticed, but the character of Red is the soul of this story.There is a reason why this film still connects with so many people & why many of them have latched on to it. There is a reason why even after two decades, its legacy keeps flourishing & viewers keep returning to it despite its low entertainment value. One major reason is that even though The Shawshank Redemption is a prison drama, its story of imprisonment goes far beyond the bricks & steel rods of a jail house. The entire picture is a reflection of our own imprisonment in the institutions of our daily lives; institutions like work, family, society etc & living up to the expectations of each one of them.On an overall scale, The Shawshank Redemption stresses that based on the outlook of life, there are only two types of people: one who can be free even in prison while others who find themselves imprisoned even in freedom. The message it is trying to resonate is clear: Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free. And if we all give ourselves some hope, there is nothing we can't survive. Yes, it all seems preachy n everything, but then if there's ever been a motion picture that has earned this sort of right, it's The Shawshank Redemption. Strongly recommended. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a well-crafted prison drama and another great movie to add to Frank Darabont's impressive filmography. Morgan Freeman is the standout as one of the most endearing characters in cinema history, while Tim Robbins and a host of excellent character actors fill out an outstanding ensemble cast that make you feel like you are there with them in that prison. This is an emotionally satisfying film with many memorable character moments sprinkled into an otherwise pretty standard plot. While I find it to be a little too sensitive at times, this is an excellent motion picture and a must see. It may deserve to be generally regarded as (one of) the most overrated film(s) ever made, but it is above all a wonderful, uplifting and deeply touching tale of hope and perseverance that certainly deserves to be remembered as one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story. \n",

      "One of Tim's best performances. He deserved all awards & nominations for this film. Definitely one of the best films I've ever seen. The best part of the movie is the whole thing. Although some parts of the movie were a bit violent, it was done with taste and I felt it was important to the story as a whole. Although the film was rather long, it still was able to hold my attention... I was never in a state of mind where I was wondering \"When is this movie going to end\", and that is very rare with me. I cannot believe I went so many years without seeing this film. It is very much a must-see film. It is great to view for ages 12 and up. This movie has such great story-telling, and uses great dialog, unlike anything you'll ever see in other films. Very well-done to the directors, crew, and especially the cast members. Outstanding. \n",

      "Usually the movies/films are NEVER as good as the BOOKS! Whether novel, novella and or short story.. Yet \"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION\" shatters that ideology. From the writing of the script, production, the casting, directing, cinematography to every \"drop\" of acting, leached, extracted most exquisitely much like the vinification of cultured grapes to a fine wine. The actors fully embody their characters until the characters are not there but the people the viewer watches as their individual lives are played out before us.This is a movie that draws you in by your very heart and soul and \"places\" you there.. You \"breath\" this film. \"You\" feel this film.

      "In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. \n",

Don't get me wrong, the story is great, but the film made some improvements, and in doing so, made a better story. I will add a note about Stand by me, another adaptation of a S. Kings novella. This time, the story took the city of Portland Maine and made it Portland Oregon; a brilliant move. The stories told within the story were removed except for a few short snippets. The pie eating contest was important, but many of the other stories told within the original novella were a little too strange and took away some of the vigor of the story for me. Two great stories, made into two greater films. \n",

After writing novels and screenplays I must say scripts are more challenging because of the format and the short lengths.This specific film reminds me of my experiences as a policeman, sheriff, and marshal. The characters were very true to life.After working in L.A. for years; I went to Reno, NV, as a sheriff. There I ran into a fellow in jail that was basically there for life.He was extremely recalcitrant. A huge problem. Thank GOD I had been always respectful to prisoners. A group of there trusties came up to me that had know me from L.A. They told me, \"Don't worry about him, Deputy Knight.\"The next night he looked like a truck hit him.

He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.one of the greatest :) \n",

      "In 1947 Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in rural Maine. Andy befriends prison contraband smuggler, Ellis \"Red\" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer and later a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly assaulted by the \"bull queer\" gang \"the Sisters\" and their leader, Bogs.In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance, and offers to help him legally shelter the money. After a vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is sent to another prison and Andy is never attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the Warden begins using Andy to handle matters for a variety of people including guards from other prisons and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decaying library.In 1954, Brooks is paroled, but cannot adjust to the outside world after fifty years in prison and hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in him receiving solitary confinement. After his release from solitary Andy explains that hope is what gets him through his time, a concept that Red dismisses. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias Randall Stephens.In 1965, Tommy Williams is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his G.E.D. exam. In 1966, Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for the murders Andy was convicted of, implying Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen and sends Andy back to solitary when he mentions the money laundering. Norton then has Hadley murder Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue the money laundering, but relents after Norton threatens to burn the library, remove Andy's protection from the guards, and move him out of his cell into worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months and tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican coastal town. Red feels Andy is being unrealistic, but promises Andy that if he is ever released he will visit a specific hayfield near Buxton, Maine and retrieve a package Andy buried there. Red becomes worried about Andy's state of mind, especially when he learns Andy asked another inmate to supply him with six feet of rope.The next day at roll call the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall, and the rock tears through the poster. Removing the poster, the warden discovers a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the last seventeen years, hidden by posters of starlets Andy acquired from Red over the years. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and used the prison's sewage pipe to reach freedom, bringing with him Norton's suit, shoes, and the ledger containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy poses as Randall Stephens and visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he mails the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.After serving forty years, Red is finally paroled. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited. \n",

      "When I was a teenager, I read a book called Different Seasons which, at the time, was a series of short stories by a man named Richard Bachman.Richard Bachman, as it turns out, was actually Stephen King.King was apparently worried that having his name on this book would cause people to have preconceived notions and possibly judge the work by his name alone, rather than by it's contents.Among the short stories in this book was one titled, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, on which the film was based.There are a lot of memorable characters and happenings throughout, and in the center of all of them is Andy Dufresne, who was accused of killing his wife for sleeping with a golf pro at the local country club.Andy claims he is innocent, but is convicted and sent to prison for the murder.This film does a very good job of staying true to the story, with only a few minor changes that do not effect the outcome.Without giving too much away, I will just say that this film is the highest rated on IMDb for a reason. It is about so many different things that it would take some time to list them, would have to contain spoilers and would not do the film justice.This movie will elicit many different emotions and is definitely worth the viewing. \n",

The movie was filmed by Stephen Kings novel so it has to be great. The story is set in 1947y Portland, Maine where a banker is is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences for murdering his wife and her lover. He will meet all sort of characters in side the prison good and bad, from inmates with good hart to sadistic prison guards.

It speaks to the quality of Stephen King's writing that it was adapted into what is, in my opinion, a beautiful movie.From the start of the movie all the way to the end, the main characters have our full sympathy as they bond in prison. There is also lingering curiosity- is Andy actually guilty?Andy, above all, is a likable character. We're cheering him on the whole way. This is not to understate Morgan Freeman's breakout performance as Red, the narrator. His voice gives the film power, of which it had plenty already.And more than anything else, it is a movie about the triumph of the human spirit, even when the deck is stacked against and the odds are a million to one. The challenges faced by the main characters only make the ending of the film all the more meaningful.The ending is, of course, beautiful.

Although there are difficult situations, there is also good ones who manage to balance coexistence, and makes the film not be so dramatic.

      "Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much- needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget. \n",

      "Excellent film of the great director Frank Darabont. Strong acting. Moderately inventive story, but not exactly unpredictable. A pleasantly uplifting film, but don't expect a transformative experience. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a gangly young banker when he enters Maine's fortress like Shawshank State Prison in 1946, accused of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover. Though his protestations of innocence don't carry much weight, his shy manner and decency does. Befriended by Red (Morgan Freeman), a veteran con who is the prison fixer, he soon draws a circle of other boyishly likable prisoners around him, including William Sadler as a sweet-tempered thug and James Whitmore as a cuddly old man who is the prison librarian. In a film that stands or falls on the central character's amiability, Tim Robbins is loose and effective, though the real performance here is from Morgan Freeman, whose projected affection for his friend really determines how we feel about him. Darabont's direction is precise and assured, without being terribly imaginative.10/10 \n",

      "From the beginning, the film seemed uninteresting, but after a few episodes, it became clear to me that I see something that rightfully occupies first place in the ranking of all the films in the history of cinema! Just think: the film walked several millions (!) Of all the other works and took his place of honor in the ranking. But leave a rating. Just want to say that 'The Shawshank Redemption' struck me deeply. Of course, the American cinema today - the best in the world, no doubt about it, but quite difficult to call the film so deep as those shot in the recent past (the same 'Forrest Gump', for example, or 'The Green Mile'). Undoubtedly, in modern times remove the masterpieces 'Philomena', 'Black Swan', 'The Imitation Game' - and other other other, but this is something else :) In the same film lifted virtually all the major themes in our lives: love, injustice in the world, the power of friendship, the spirit of resistance, the possibility of a man and his faith in life. And boundless hope. In my opinion, the most important thing: the movie gives us hope and creates the soul boundless sense, a kind of urge to life, to change, the desire for freedom ... The actors performed their roles brilliantly! However, no one doubted the Hollywood giants such as Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Bob Gunton, who plays cruel prison director - a devout and religious man whose faith in God but does not prevent (rather the contrary) to be one of the worst things in the world, also very memorable with his play. The rest of the actors are also perfectly coped with their roles - all performed at the highest level! Absolutely nothing to complain about - and do not want to quibble. Surprisingly, as in the movie, where almost everything is happening within the prison, where there is cruelty, violence and hopelessness, all this combined with the finest things such as hope, faith, love, friendship, willpower and strength of mind Thanks to the skills ... director and all those who worked on the film, it was possible to combine it all in perfect form, which makes an indelible impression on the viewer. I think that these films make us better and cleaner inside. We understand that we have one life - and should appreciate it until we are given a great opportunity to live in this land. To believe in a brighter future - and to do everything possible to make it so it was. It is this thought and inspires our hearts with this film ... ADVISE VIEW anyone and everyone! It 'musthave' for anyone who appreciates good films. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is able to radically change the view of the world - and that is why it is a masterpiece that truly deserves to stand in front of all the movies ... \n",

During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation.Despite being a box office disappointment, the film received multiple award nominations (including seven Oscar nominations) and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism.

Digging yourself out may be dirty, but from experience, it is rough and worth it. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" carries weight through its entirety, showing the viewer the strength a man must have to live in a normal society, or rather one without freedom.This review does not reveal any spoilers but describes a couple distinct factors. Respectfully, the plot must have been drawn out of a poem written by Edgar Allen Poe, in my opinion. If you like crime, suspense, or drama \"The Shawshank Redemption\" may suffice. In addition, this film causes for destruction of social class, yet integrates wisdom with opportunity for success. Crawling through this rough period of confinement, two men have met for a purpose. While wisdom plays the man trusted into this society, wary of the system's structure and smart to play it safe, opportunity specializes in gaining trust, working to evolve like a stem to a tree, finding ways to set himself free. Although, the men are not ready for everything this prison has to offer. In return, the physical and mental strength both men benefit Unlike many movies, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" perceives the pros and cons of relationships with self and others, guising intentions, efforts, and social class.

These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek. \n",

      "Wonderful movie, based on determination, hard work and intelligence. Use of time at it best In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi \n",

One great thing I liked about the movie is that it is not shown from the perspective of its hero (Andy Duferene) but it is shown from the perspective of Red(Morgan Freeman). The film starts with a courtroom scene where Andy is given two life sentences as he is convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover. Then the story goes inside the prison and stays there. We see how Andy is different from others. How he risks his life for getting beer for his friends and things like. Red is the closest person to Andy in person. Andy, by his skills, impresses the prison staff, so they allow him to write letters to government officials for funds for prison library and also they utilize it to run their scams. The movie doesn't seem to show pity over Andy's condition. It purely deals with it in a subjective manner.

      "One of the best movie all time. This is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. \n",

      "This film tells the story of a banker who is arrested for a crime he did't commit and sent to a prison where he tries to adapt, despite the hardness of the day-to-day life. Based on a Stephen Kink's novel and directed by Frank Darabont, has an excellent cast headed by Tim Robbins, who plays the banker, and Morgan Freeman, who gives life to an inmate, particularly skilled in the art of smuggling goods inside the prison.Darabont deserves congratulations for the way he directed the film and wrote the screenplay. Thanks to him, this film is human and sentimental without exaggeration. Tim Robbins shone in its interpretation of banker Andrew Dufresne, a man shaken by the sudden collapse of his way of life, but that doesn't cease to dream with freedom and to help those who share his misfortune, even in the worst moments. Thanks to Robbins, Andrew Dufresne isn't a mere banker betrayed by fate, but a deeply generous and human person. Far from spending time lamenting his injustice or his downfall, this Dufresne is more concerned to adapt to his new situation and provide to his cell mates the means to \"trick the bad luck\" and maintain their hope, that same hope that he, himself, always tries to maintain. Another actor that deserves particular attention is Morgan Freeman, who incorporates \"Red\" Redding, a longtime inmate, admittedly guilty, that recounts the events in the first person. Bob Gunton gives body to the prison director who, with the Bible in his hand, will not hesitate to do all the things the Bible disapproves. However, despite the deserved highlights, it must be said that the entire cast of the film deserves congratulations and reached excellence. The technical aspects of the film are equally blameless, with photography and soundtrack to deserve particular attention and to strengthen the human side of this story where, despite the windows have bars, there is always a sun cross for them.It's not by chance or by grace that this film is considered by many one of the best films ever. In fact, it won this award by right, among other distinctions achieved (seven nominations for the Oscar, two Golden Globe nominations etc...). Acclaimed by the critics, it was a relative commercial failure, which only prove to us that what is done to sell rarely is good enough to stay for posterity.

It is a complete pity that the movie released in the year of 1994, because it was robbed of a well deserved Oscar, given pulp fiction and and Forrest gump also released the same year.....this movie has everything. ...memorable performances, characters, a good story....it also has a lot of repeat value...this is a kind of movie which you can go back to whenever you are down in life...there are a few cinematic liberties taken....but thats pardonable. \n",

      "Well, well, well, I finally got round to seeing this so-called masterpiece; praised as the best film ever and frankly, I agree.What makes this film a true viewing pleasure is a number of components. Firstly it is superbly filmed, capturing every moment at the best possible angle making it easy to watch. The performances are fantastic Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman play their parts exponentially well, so convincing you lose yourself in the Shawshank world. The music also makes the key moments of the plot ever more intense and moving. Another point is that it is not too long and drags on but is not cut too short; the perfect length.In conclusion, I would highly recommend it and I really enjoyed it with its exciting storey, great performances, fantastic music and the ideal length it is truly worth the title of the best film ever! \n",

I cant say it is the best movie ever made, because there is not a number 1 best movie. But this movie is a legendary classic A must see. The movie is based on the novel by Stephen King The director Frank Darabont have also written the script. And Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are the stars, and they are playing sublime. The Shawshank Redemption was nominated for 7 Oscars including best picture, best script and best leading actor(Morgan Freeman) Oscars 1995 is one of the greatest years in Oscar history, where Forrest Gump ran with the most of the prices including best picture, best director and leading role. Taratino won best script(Pulp Fiction) So it is understandable that The Shawshank Redemption didn't win any Oscars even tho it deserved too. I think its a better movie than both Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction - but you cant win any time - but you can still be a winner without a price :) \n",

      "n 1946 a young New England banker, Andy Dufresne (Robbins), is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to life at the Shawshank State Prison - twice over. Quiet and introspective, he gradually strikes up a friendship with the prison 'fixer', Red (Freeman), and over the next two decades wins the trust of the governor and guards, but in his heart, he still yearns for freedom. Darabont's adaptation of a Stephen King novella is a throwback to the kind of serious, literate drama Hollywood used to make (Birdman of Alcatraz, say) though the big spiritual resolution takes some swallowing - ditto the colour-blind relationships within the prison and the violent disavowal of any homosexual implications. Against this weighs the pleasure of discovering a first-time director with evident respect for the intelligence of his audience, brave enough to let character details accumulate without recourse to the fast- forward button. Darabont plays the long game and wins: this is an engrossing, superbly acted yarn, while the Shawshank itself is a truly formidable mausoleum. \n",

      "My first inspirational movie of my entire life... In 1947 Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in rural Maine. Andy befriends prison contraband smuggler, Ellis \"Red\" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer and later a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly assaulted by the \"bull queer\" gang \"the Sisters\" and their leader, Bogs. In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him legally shelter the money. After a vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is sent to another prison and Andy is never attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the Warden begins using Andy to handle matters for a variety of people including guards from other prisons and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decaying library. \n",

Tim Robbins, the lead in this movie, creates a great duo with Morgan Freeman, with the dialogue shared between the two feeling natural, as well as superb acting from both. The story line is what presents the backbone for these great performances as the narrative is a major part of what makes it one of the greatest films of all time. A man is accused for his wife's murder, is sent to prison where he serves life sentences which gives him the time to redeem himself (though he did not commit the crime is accused of) and eventually escape.

The other is the one where is so memorable that watching one time will result in you remembering it forever, even if you never ever watch it again. Shawshank Redemption is the latter.The movie itself contains no fast-paced action or fantasy, but the gradual progression of the movie makes way for character growth and realism. In nearly 150 minutes, the viewers find themselves living and growing with Andy and Red, urging for them to make a move and yet never quite certain if they will.I don't really have any words that I can say about this movie other than the fact that it is the type of masterpiece that makes you think hard about everything. \n",

M big fan of Frank Darabont.With each movie this man is creating a bench mark.Cinematography was equally impressive.Morgan freeman was at his best Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as \"The Movie\". When I say \"The Movie\", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those \"Budget Theaters\" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said \"That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!\" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... \"HOPE\". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just \"comes together\" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a \"must buy\" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, \"That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!\" There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my \"favorite of all time\", but they've all fallen far short of \"The Shawshank Redemption\". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately. You're guaranteed to find it in the \"employee picks\" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them. \n",

One person with a big heart can make such a difference. For being a simple drama without any real action, romance, or special effects, Shawshank Redemption does a phenomenal job of drawing in the viewer and creating intense scenes at every turn. The characters are vivid and easy to relate to. When so many movies today revolve around computer generated graphics, explosions, fight scenes, and sex, it is refreshing to watch a movie that reminds us all of what life is really about.

The friendships he makes and the way in which Andy brightens up the world around him is inspirational. \n",

She informs Andy that she wants a divorce in Reno which he denied her.

      "Shawshank Prison! Andy arrives at Shawshank with the same blank facial expression that granted him the bus ride to the prison. As the welcoming committee provided a grand opening to the bus load of \"Fresh Fish\" inmates. This single file march of leg irons clanking, feet shuffling across the dusty prison yard, as fresh fish pass by the thunderous claps, and yelling voices which intimated some of the new fish. Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman) placed a bet of 10 cigarettes on the new fish named Andy Dufresne. Andy has a naive way of thinking, along with his new normal routine of strolling the prison yard in search of smooth rocks while keeping to himself. Andy finally breaks his silence after a month and engages in a conversation with Red. Andy's life sentence was almost cut short while eavesdropping on a conversation of the brutal Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown). Since Andy befriends Red and his crew of intimates Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), Heywood (William Sadler), Jigger (Neil Giuntoli), Floyd (Brian Libby), and Skeet (Larry Brandenburg), he placed a request for a bottle of suds after the rigged roof job is completed by this team of inmates. Andy was able to do his \"Real Job\" again by performing banking services for every prison guard in Shawshank. Although he longed for this new freedom Andy still has to fight off his predator Boggs Diamond (Mark Rolston). Andy is on the verge of losing his freedom due to his overzealous attitude toward Warden Norton (Bob Gunton). The Warden provides Andy with a few options while he spends two months in solitary confinement to reset his mind and his mouth. This melodramatic crime film will have your emotions racing as you cook up a new avenue for Andy to travel down. The actors in \"The Shawshank Redemption\" have a more boisterous tone compared to the relaxed spoken actors in \"The Green Mile\" John Coffey (Michael Clark Duncan), Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), Brutus \"Brutal\" Howell (David Morse), \"Wild Bill\" Wharton (Sam Rockwell), Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter), and Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper). The lighting for these two melodramatic crime films are different. Both John Coffey and Andy Dufresne are in prison for murder. Andy has more of a dark shadow over his face at times probably due to depression and when harm is coming his way. The lighting changes for him when he is able to accomplish a \"normal / human\" side of his past. John Coffey has a brighter atmosphere when is able to arouse those around him to think outside the box and have a more positive attitude in their heart toward life. John and Andy have to figure out which way to go in order to have freedom while in prison. \n",

Furthermore I also praise Darabont for turning King's short story into an almost 3-hour long drama without losing the basic message of the book and its atmosphere. Namely how different the two main characters are who represent a certain life philosophy : Red is the pessimistic one who never raises hope because life taught him that there is none but Andy is the total opposite: He never loses his hope even in such a terrible place.

The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, \"Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.\" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made.

When I say realistic I mean that the events do not always take place in the way you want and sometimes you even come to a stage you lose hope on behalf of the people acting but somehow those events are later shown to be the steps for the greater purpose. Then you say to yourself, there could be good in what you see evil, there could be evil in what you see good. The movie teaches a lot of life experience. \n",

      "This is simply marvelous entertainment that breathes life into a genre that I thought had been dead for a decade-the prison picture. But to call \"The Shawshank Redemption\" a prison picture is as accurate as calling \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" a hospital picture. Those are the settings of these similar films, but they really are inspirational dramas of individuals struggling against overbearing authority. Tim Robbins, one of our best, most casual, young actors, plays a banker in the 1940s who is falsely sent to Shawshank Prison for the death of his wife and her lover. In this maximum security penitentiary, Robbins is harassed by the warden, beaten by guards, and sexually abused by inmates. The first and best friend he makes is the elder statesman of the yard, a longtime convict played by the great Morgan Freeman. Over time, Robbins will make other friends, some of whom will be absolutely paralyzed by freedom in the straight world. Even better than \"Birdman of Alcatraz,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates the world of overbearing closure that is prison. \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" was set in confinement, too, and like that story, the narrative drive of \"The Shawshank Redemption\"- based on a story by the prolific Stephen King-is a journey of freedom, physical and psychological. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" comes out of nowhere in the sense that it is a first feature film by Frank Darabont, who, with this one work, declares himself a special talent. He adapted King's story for the screen and insisted on directing the story too, much in the same way that Sylvester Stallone could not be pried loose from \"Rocky.\" Guts equals glory. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is playing at the Water Tower and Old Orchard Theaters. If you can't get into see \"Quiz Show,\" this should be your next choice. \n",

The movie talks about friendship, love , crime , passion, corruption but the most important of all is HOPE, \"hope is a dangerous thing\" that is the fact we should all know, but how many of us can face the danger? Which amazed me more in the movie that it gave us the fact that some people are dead even if they look alive, because if we don't live as we want we are already dead people! Yes it is the best movie I've ever watched, and I wish to see other masterpieces from Darabont in the near future. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most deep, incredible, inspiring, and beautiful films ever made, I cannot watch this movie without a pure smile on my face from the greatness and genius of this film. After being convicted of murdering his wife, something he denies, smart and banker Andy Duffrain (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank prison, which is run by a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton). He makes friends with some of the inmates but his closest relationship is with Red (Morgan Freeman) a wise lifer who is a you want it, he can get sort of guy. After many years there, and after the last straw from the warden, Andy does something that will be remembered throughout the history of Shawshank prison. The lot of this film is equally incredible with story and characters, we love whats going on the entire film because every moment is important to the ending of the film, and the characters of the movie are just perfection, Andy and Red as best friends is probably the greatest friendship I have ever seen a film and that makes it impossible to dislike them and how colorful and fun the supporting characters are, what an incredible and beautiful movie that shows the horrors of prison. The cast is just incredible, Tim Robbins plays his most memorable and best performance of his career if you ask me, and Morgan Freeman has also his greatest role to date and truly deserved his Oscar as much as everyone else that year, they were just incredible. The score of the film is not just amazing, that is not saying enough to how beautiful and masterful the music was, every minute this music was playing gave the movie its feel that made it feel like a real drama I think. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most intense and incredible dramas you will ever see, I am not resenting when I say this is my favorite drama film of all time and always will be, Frank Darabont has made many Stephen King adaptions but this is his best and his masterpiece, if you need a very inspirational and incredible film, I need you to see this film. \n",

      "In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi \n",

Now before that starts some race debate about the topic, I only am pointing out how the times were in the 1940's, 50's, etc. My issue with that topic is that I think we should accurately portray society as it was no matter how ugly it was, not as we wish it had been. \n",

Morgan Freeman's acting cannot be flawed but Tim Robinson, as good as he was, never seemed to show enough energy or desperation to portey the role. The direction of the film is insane. The camera work seems to let it down though, where there is a lot of wide screen moments, which could have been close ups. This would have emphasised the acting. In my opinion the role Tim Robinson played could have used a better actor, however I do think he is a very talented actor. Perhaps a better actor could have been Brad Pitt. His acting in Se7en shows that he can play an angry, loving and deperate character and I think he would have done the role more justice.

I can understand the argument for this as it's hard to fathom anyone not liking it, meaning there won't be many 1-star reviews bringing the average down. Perhaps the lack of female characters might jar with some, or the use of familiar tropes like prison rape, nasty warden, brutal officers, the protagonist being wrongly imprisoned and Morgan Freeman being his best friend.Shawshank is 20 years old now so maybe deserves some leeway in using these tropes, especially when considering how effectively they're used. You really feel with Andy, and can't help but like Red. The acting from the entire cast is excellent, and there are individual moments of classic drama that stay with you for a long time (Brooks...) and also beautiful pathos (the round of cold beers).If you haven't seen it yet but plan to, then I wouldn't expect the Greatest Movie Ever, but go in with no expectations and you'll really enjoy it. \n",

It takes place over about 20 years, which is somewhat incredible, and we get to be firsthand witnesses to Andy's time in jail over such a long period of time.

N°1 movie on IMDb, Amercian Film Institute 72nd best film of all time, 91% on rottentomatoes, I had to see this \"masterpiece\". Well, this is in no case worthy of the name, it's an excellent movie, but not to the point of deserving such a worship. The story is very beautiful and the characters are very touching but, from a purely cinematographic point of view, there's nothing amazing about it. Any movie from Kubrick, for instance, deserve way more the first place on IMDb than The Shawshank Redemption because it really marked film history (I'm talking about Kubrick because it's the first name that popped into my head, but it's not the only one obviously). I still recommend this very beautiful movie, of course, but if I had to do a list of the best films of all time according to me, it would never be in it. \n",

      "Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen. The acting was brilliant, you believed what everyone said (some films the words are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness, that it makes you want to throw up). I have watched Spiderman, and even the lines in that make you feel that they mean nothing, they just sound good. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title. \n",

It is emotional and you are bound to shed a few tears. I don't know many movies with two main actors, but their roles here are very truthful to what may be real persons experiences. I loved the movie also because it does give you hope that injustices done by others to you will be - one day or eventually - 'paid' in a way or that something good is waiting for you after the hard times. Anyway, a story you can not simply not love. I may see it 20 years later, but it is universal movie. Go and see it \n",

      "This movie offers less in terms of plot twists, character development and acting than what I think people realise. Morgan Freeman delivers a characteristically mundane performance and the other characters dance forgettably around him.There are few to no memorable quotes and even less action, and the only real twist, at the end, could be the most overrated twist of all time.I only watched this after it was deemed a must by most of my close peers and fellow movie critics, only to be gravely disappointed with their judgments. If this movie has taught me anything, it is that IMDb ratings mean jack and that people are, in general, conformist in nature ; they rate movies highly if their fellow humans talk it up. Who could forget the terrible acting and the sexual innuendos in this movie? The only reason that the director put that in there was to make it feel more prison like, but for me it felt as if he was trying to plug a bathtub with a million holes. A tub full of vomit to begin with.Frankly, I do not care if this is an unpopular view. And neither should you. Popularity is a reflection of the current state of society's desires, nothing more. \n",

      "In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. \n",

The movie depicts how a four lettered word 'Hope' brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possible.Though the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane, a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison, the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of Andy Dufrane (just amazing) and how he influences his fellow prisoner 'Red'. The narration by Morgan Freeman in the role of 'Red' is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across. This story proves that the king of horrors, Stephen King, is equally good at any other genre of 'Story Writing'(Hats off). The dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring.

Firstly the silence of Tim Robbins and the euphoria around Morgan Freeman. The scene on the terrace where Tim Robbins proves his mettle is a reminder of our latent abilities.

      "If you were asked to name one actor capable of playing ex-cons, hit men, and God, you'd be hard pressed to do any better than Morgan Freeman -- which is, probably not coincidentally, why he's played all those characters (among many others) over the course of his distinguished, nearly 50-year career. And even as he reaches the half-century mark as a professional actor, Freeman shows no signs of slowing down. When it premiered on September 23, 1994, \"The Shawshank Redemption\" barely registered at the box office. The prison drama opened at No. 9, below the odious sex comedy \"Exit to Eden\" and just above Robert Redford's \"Quiz Show,\" already in its fifth week. Though nominated for seven Academy Awards, the film failed to connect with audiences and vanished from theaters with little fanfare. And then, slowly but surely, its fortunes began to change. On its 20th anniversary, here's how \"The Shawshank Redemption\" beat the odds and became a beloved classic. \n",

      "This is a motivational story about a group of people in prison. It shows them going through many different conflicts. Most of the guards treat them badly and often abuse the inmates. The ugly realities of prison life are realized in the first half hour of the movie. There was strong acting on all parts. It was expertly shot too. It deserves all of the praise it has received. It's been near the top of IMDb's top 10 for years and it's showing no signs of slowing down. It's very moving and it has a lot of character development. It perfectly represents all the struggles that the characters go through. Also, the movie is highly brutal. Especially near the beginning. This isn't for anyone who doesn't like brutality but it's rather fitting in this movie. The way it combined brutality with a highly memorable story makes it something special. It touched me in a way that I cannot describe. Without any doubt, it's the best drama ever and one of the greatest movies of all time. \n",

What makes Shawshank the best movie of all time in Cinema is the simplicity in which the story has been told. From beginning to end, not only you see different beautiful characters in the movie living their life in a prison, but you start to live it with them for the entire duration. Every single emotion and characteristic of humans have been touched, right from love, lust, anger, frustration, corruption, guilt, friendship, redemption and most importantly the HOPE. This is one of the most motivating films of all time. I doubt there has been any single viewer, who watched the movie and didn't feel happy at the end. I prefer watching Shawshank every time I have had a bad phase in life. The film will just fill your heart with warmth and make you feel good about life in general about how there is always a light after the end of the tunnel, no matter how long the tunnel is, but only if you hope for it and don't give up.Have you seen the mime saying 'I want Morgan Freeman to narrate my life'?

      "THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely one of Stephen King's more restrained kind of stories, dealing mostly with a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the consequences that await them when the tale ends.TIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long prison term while MORGAN FREEMAN (who plays the narrator with great dignity) describes himself as \"the only guilty man in Shawshank.\" The hardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the viewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape. Along the way, he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a brutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish. But Robbins is quietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he takes charge of the prison library and sees to it that there's a wider selection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for writing. A touch of irony here, no? The closing scenes are a bit of a stretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison tale--but still, they make an impact because of all that happens before.It's a bittersweet story, a sort of horrific fairy-tale of what might have happened, but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of the tremendously skillful story-telling magic of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay. \n",

I believe that this is Morgan's best role ever. Tim also nails it, but Morgan stole the show. He portrays one who can get anything and pretty much runs the inside, and he plays it well.

Shawshank is something which we all are in, a state of mind.every one of us can be Andy if you believe in hope.Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, raping and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form.The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wise guy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doom Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle. \n",

      "This movie is a true masterpiece, and it's a real pity that it never really got recognition and box office success it deserved. If Forrest Gump, also a very good movie, hadn't come out the same year, I have no doubt that Shawshank would have taken top honors at the Oscars.At the center of the story is Andy Dufrense, a bank executive wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her lover. Our first impression of him is that he's a bookworm, a nerd, the kind of man who won't last long behind bars. But it becomes clear soon on that he is filled with a great inner strength, one that allows him not only to endure his ordeal, but to keep his sanity and his humanity.Andy soon befriends Red (Morgan Freeman), the prison's top scrounger. Having spent the last twenty years on the inside the walls, Red serves as the film's wise old man, giving Andy (and the viewer) the ground rules, dispensing advice, and trading in contraband. He's sympathetic and loyal to his friends, but being in prison has given him a cynical streak that grows as the movie progresses. He also narrates the story, and does a masterful job. There's neither a single line of unnecessary narration, nor any scenes where more is needed.Andy's skill with numbers eventually gets him in good with the guards, whose taxes he does. Before long, he enters the services of the warden. And once the warden begins a program of using the convicts as cheap labor- and pocketing the profits- Andy becomes one of the nation's best crooked accountants. As for the warden himself, he's an interesting character. He comes across a fairly benign, if somewhat self-righteous; his piety and talk of redemption contrasting with the actions of those under him. But as his schemes unfold, his villainous nature becomes apparent.I don't know if there has ever been a more realistic, more sympathetic portrayal of prison life and what it does to a man. In every scene, this movie tells it like it really is. It doesn't shy away from the brutal beatings at the hands of sadistic guards, or the horrors of prison rape. But at the same time, it remains tasteful, never stooping to the level of crass exploitation or violence for its own sake.Shawshank also gives the viewer a sense of the boredom and monotony that makes up the bulk of a prisoner's life, without becoming boring or monotonous itself. It also shows the feelings of camaraderie and close friendships that can develop between inmates. I've heard that the only bonds between soldiers in combat can compare to those between prison buddies, and based on this film, I wouldn't doubt it. The little things are perfectly captured as well: the cigarette trade, the obsession with the female image- to the point that you'll watch the same movie a dozen times just for that one scene with that one actress, and of course the way that every man in prison insists that he's innocent and it's all a big mistake.Through the experiences of Brooks, the old librarian, we also see little known dilemma of so many long-term inmates returning to society. Despite all the hardships of prison life, the drudgery, the bad food, the loss of freedom, Brooks has become not only accustomed to, but dependent on life within the walls. After all the years he's spent at Shawshank Penitentiary he's forgotten the outside world, and the outside world, in turn, has moved on, becoming something completely different from what he once knew. All of his friends, his life's work, and his purpose are there in the prison. Inside, he's well liked, a learned man and intellectual among his peers. Outside, he's just an ex-con who's past his prime and not so steady on his feet anymore.A real measure of this movie's greatness is that so much depth is given, and so much sympathy generated, for someone who is really a minor player. His story is only a subplot, yet this film spends more time and effort characterizing him than many movies spend on their main characters.Another important theme is what confinement can do to a man's soul. After years behind bars, most of the inmate's spirits are downtrodden, if not broken. For them, true happiness is but a memory; hope an entirely foreign idea. \"Hope is dangerous. Hope can get you killed.\" Red tells Andy at one point. But Andy is not like the others. He clings on to hope, even when he has every reason to believe he'll spend the rest of his life in Shawshank. He's determined that no matter what, he will not let his spirit be broken.The ending is one of the best I've ever seen, and I wouldn't dream of giving this one away. I will say that nearly everything that's happened up to now has, in one way or another, led to this, and that when it's over, you'll be amazed and uplifted.Shawshank is right up there with the best of Copula, Spielberg, or Kurosawa. It's the kind of movie that can restore your faith in cinema. No matter how many lackluster sequels or half-baked packaged deals the studios come out with, there will always be the Shawshank Redemption. \n",

All of those elements make The Shawshank Redemption not only one of the best Stephen King adaptations but a movie that is cinema at it's best.Based on the Novella Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King,The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins),a banker who is serving two life prison sentences for killing his wife and lover(although he claims he's innocent)at Shawshank prison. While at the prison Andy meets fellow inmate Red(Morgan Freeman)a man who can get things inside and the two form a long friendship while dealing with life in Shawshank prison.Released in 1994,The Shawshank Redemption is a truly brilliant and outstanding film that was the directorial debut of Frank Darabont and his first feature film adaptation of a Stephen King tale. Despite receiving rave reviews from critics and earning 7 Academy Award nominations The Shawshank Redemption wasn't a huge hit at the Box Office and was overshadowed by other classic movies released the same year such as Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump. But thanks to television showings and success on Home Video The Shawshank Redemption became a classic and one of the most memorable movies of all-time. The Shawshank Redemption is a film that is an instant classic the first time you watch it and is a movie that is powerful and dramatic,meaningful and gripping,uplifting and sad as well as humorous and light. All of those elements give Shawshank Redemption an emotional weight that reminds viewers why film is such a beautiful art form because it's a film where just everything works from the direction,acting and writing where everything is flawless. The Shawshank Redemption is a prison movie that has some of the grit and brutality of other prison movies but the storyline is much different and unpredictable than other prison films with messages and themes that are repeated throughout such as hope,life and optimism despite being in prison and dealing with the hardships. It's rare to see or hear such themes talked about in a prison movie but that is one of the things that makes Shawshank stand out from the other movies in the prison genre. Shawshank also shows viewers what a talented and versatile writer Stephen King truly is showing us that King can not do Horror and Science Fiction but can also do Drama. Shawshank along with other great Stephen King adaptations such as The Green Mile and Stand By Me are prime examples that King can do Drama. Shawshank also deals with not only prison life but also the passage of time going from the 1940s to the 1960s with posters of beautiful and sexy actresses such as Rita Hayworth,Marliyn Monroe and Raquel Welch showing that while time stands still in prison the world can move pretty fast. The pace of this movie is just terrific going by fast making you feel like you're watching a 90 minute film than a 2 and half hour one. The screenplay by Frank Darabont is amazing and memorable with dialog that is fresh and powerful as well as memorable and thoughtful. Shawshank's two main characters Andy and Red are classic characters who are the anchors of the film showing viewers the kind of friendship that lasts a long time. Andy and Redd look at prison life in different ways,Andy despite serving a life sentence believes that there is still hope beyond the prison walls and no one not the warden or the guards can't touch inside of him. Whereas Red is opposite and more cynical believe there is just prison life and that's all there is. However,despite their opposite ways of thinking Andy and Red's friendship and bond is strong and grows as the film goes on and when you see these two throughout the movie you will feel that there is redemption and hope for Andy and Red. Andy and Red is one of the best depictions of friendship in movie history and you will never forget these characters after the film is over. The final 20-30 minutes of The Shawshank Redemption is one of greatest endings ever seen on film because there is surprises and happiness that will make you smile and cry with joy. A masterful conclusion.The cast is outstanding. Tim Robbins is excellent and at his best as Andy Dufresne,with Robbins bringing a power and emotional depth to the performance. Morgan Freeman is brilliant and his best as well as Red,Andy's best friend and prison mate. Robbins and Freeman are magical together and have great scenes. Bob Gunton is fantastic and memorable as Wardon Norton,a corrupt prison Wardon. William Sadler is terrific and funny as Heywood,Andy and Red's friend and fellow prisoner. Clancy Brown is amazing and menacing as Captain Hadley,a Shawshank's brutal guard. Gil Bellows is sensational as Tommy,a young convict. James Whitmore is outstanding as Brooks,an old timer and prisoner. Mark Rolston(Bogs),Larry Brandenburg(Skeet),Brian Libby(Floyd),Neil Giuntoli(Jigger),David Proval(Snooze),Joseph Ragno(Ernie)and Jeffrey McDunn(1946 D.A)give good performances as well.The direction by Frank Darabont is fantastic and stunning,with Darabont moving the camera with tracking shots,low angles with beautiful and harsh lighting. Great direction,Darabont.The score by Thomas Newman is terrific,beautiful and epic and is fits with the movie's tone. Incredible score,Newman.In final word,if you love Tim Robbins,Morgan Freeman,Frank Darabont,Stephen King,Prison Films or movies in general,I highly suggest you see The Shawshank Redemption,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you can watch again and again and is cinema at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10. \n",

      "Stephen King has been known for writing stories that have both confused and amused the readers. Many great directors have worked with his stories and have given the audience what they want to see. The Shawshank Redemption is another one of them. But there is a reason why it is not just another one of them.The movie represents courage, faith, anger, sufferance, patience and all the other components of a perfect drama. It teaches so much and is quite a slow movie. Yet it is one of the most exiting movies I have seen in my life. The greatest thing about this movie is that it won't ever bore you. When you sit to watch a 142 minute long movie, it is not unnatural to look at the clock and see how much of it is left. But I have not looked at the clock once in all the many times that I have seen this movie. The time frame where the movie takes place is very large. But for not once have I felt that it was going too fast.Director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay for the movie did a great job with excellent actors like Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. He made this movie into one of the best there is and one of the best there will ever be. \n",

      "Never a film had given such a direct meaning to freedom, not a physical freedom but the one that dwells in the human soul. With this masterpiece seems the director, Frank Darabont, wants to prove Seneca's thesis. Seneca, in fact, argued that a man can be free on the throne or in chains. Though the role was firstly offered to other actors (Kevin Costner, Tom Hanks and Brad Pitt), Tim Robbins's Dufresne is extraordinarily expressive. The script is well adapted from the Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, and though Red was supposed to be Irish I forgive Darabont because he gave to the whole world the opportunity to see an amazing Morgan Freeman. I'm actually disappointed this film didn't won any of the seven Academy Awards nomination received (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing). \n",

The film is a period piece, so though I've only just recently watched it, and noted the date it was made- it doesn't even matter. The characters are real, and the settings are very authentic. There were only a couple of things I can honestly say I didn't like. One of them was how prison life seemed to be portrayed. I think it was a lot worse than what was shown. I also disliked how 'all-powerful' the warden was. It was heartbreaking when he had the character of Tommy Williams killed off. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were fantastic! \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances. The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 epic American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. It is ranked #1 in IMDb's \"Top 250\" list based on over a million votes (9.3 out of 10) and is considered one of the best movies of all time.Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation.Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray. It was included in the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movies 10th Anniversary Edition. \n",

      "I have read thousands of books, and seen thousands of movies. This was one of the very few motion pictures that not only captivated the attention of the audience with an epic storyline, but was also a masterpiece of cinematography.The film contains every single characteristic of truly exceptional storytelling: The story has a solid protagonist and clearly defined antagonists. The events allow us to escape our petty concerns of the moment, and personally identify with the injustice of life. The cinematography breaks the barriers of present day prejudice, without ever directly referencing them. The concepts presented show us what is within our control, and what is decided for us. The dialogue bears witness to the realities we prefer to ignore, without actually giving us unwanted imagery.Most important of all, the film's climax provides us with a shining example of what we all crave: no matter the challenges we face, hope is the only thing that cannot be taken from us. If we retain hope, we will achieve the redemption that every individual seeks.I don't believe any one story can be given the title of the best of all time. However, this film comes as close as motion pictures can achieve. \n",

      "This movie is amazing, no doubt about it. Forget about all the people saying it's the most overrated movie of all time, they're just bitter. Maybe Shawshank didn't have the most amazing, jaw-dropping cinematography, camera work, etc. ever from start to finish (all the things that made films such as the Godfather so great. Granted, it's not like Shawshank had a lot to work with since a majority of the film was set at the prison), but it had an enjoyable, moving, inspirational story. It also had really enjoyable characters, particularly Andy Dufresne, who is my favorite fictional character. I liked him from the start.Anyway, I think the Shawshank Redemption is the highest rated movie on this site because it's simply a great film. Easy to understand and follow, easy to love, and easy to be moved by. As IMDb has in the FAQ for this movie, \"It is perhaps worthwhile to remember that the top 250 list doesn't really measure what individuals consider the best movies of all time. It measures the collective opinion of the films in which people have the greatest positive feel when they are rating it. People are not voting for the movie against other movies. They are voting for it based on their opinion at the time have decided to rate it on IMDb.\" So, when people complain about how it's overrated, just think about that.Tim Robbins, when asked about why he chose to do this movie, (in addition to saying how he was moved and inspired by the story) said, \"",
      "it's not just about prison. It's about the limitations we put on ourselves and life, and the limitations, more importantly, we allow others to place on us. And if we listen to them, and we believe what these people are saying to us, then we're really building walls around ourselves. We're really building our own prison",
      " What the film is saying in a larger way is that in order to keep alive and keep living in a strong and thorough way that oftentimes you have to look beyond the walls around you. And you have to not believe in the prison and believe in that light, and that hope, and that person that you think you can be, and the person that you believe you are, and not listen to what your boss is saying, what your spouse is saying, what your leaders are saying.\" I don't think I can elaborate much further. The Shawshank Redemption taught me to hold onto hope and believe in myself. I'm reminded of that Emily Dickinson poem, \"Hope is the Thing with Feathers,\" and I think it represents a lot of what Andy stood for. \n",

The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle. \n",

      "First, I read Stephen King's \"Different Seasons\" as soon as it came out (I was around 19 I guess), and was enthralled by his writing. Of course, I had no idea 3 out of the 4 novellas would eventually adapted into movies, but I am not surprised. It is impossible to put whatever pictures you have in your mind onto the screen, so that is why everyone compares the book to the movie. The same happened to me with \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" (HIGHLY recommend reading the book), even with Bogie playing, it was a tough transition to see it on the screen. I assume at least 80-90% of those who saw either one never read the books. ANYway...the Shawshank Redemption was very \"full\" of character development, and amazing passion from Morgan Freeman especially. He is an expert in his craft, and for me, his peak. I will be watching this soon again with my wife who has not seen many American films. \n",

      "Shawshank is a emotionally diverse and wonderful story of friendship that takes place in a harsh, rough prison setting. The acting in this movie was superb! It easily has to be one of the top movies made in the last few decades. Morgan Freeman was outstanding as \"Red\" a jail broker, who knew how to get what anyone needed. Tim Robbins as \"Andy\", a like able banker from the city, who was wrongly convicted of murdering his wife. He gets sentenced to Shawshank prison. Andy and Red begin to take you on a story involving many different emotions regarding life in prison and the relationships that are formed and develop. The various events that they occur during their time in prison kept me engaged throughout this long movie. This movie left me satisfied and fulfilled as a movie goer.

This is not just life set in motion that takes us through it all - jealousy, hopelessness, irony, tragedy, monotony, inspiration, perseverance, success, and the unending miracle that is life itself. This is all of these and more.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is as much about the story it tells as about the way it tells it. We have to really immerse ourselves to understand and share the protagonist's exuberance of redemption that is the principal focal point of the entire film. And the slow and steady unfolding of events in an apparent idyllic manner makes it very easy for us viewers to get engrossed into this wonderfully threaded, emotionally rich story.All the actors in the film were in perfect tune with one another. Never for once did any of them give an impression that this is a work of fiction and not a true incident captured on camera in real time. Tim Robbins is easily the finest of the cast, portraying the initially deranged, subsequently fearful and tentative, and ultimately the emancipated Andy Dufresne with total compulsion. Morgan Freeman is equally captivating as the wise and ever-supportive \"Red\" Redding, with his wry indifference to the sufferings of life, which finally gives way plain and raw happiness at his own emancipation.This is a film that makes us appreciate the beauty and subtlety of life, soothes our soul, gives us hope and inspires us to keep trying till we reach our own \"redemption\" - our own freedom from the failures that bind us to the success that we always crave.

He can make a lot of technique in that time but some shot has a mistake. We will can observe some shot is not real or unusual. I think overall are great. I copy some technique to improve my film too.

It has inclined Mr Freemans position in my heart. Acting is mind blowing, with the perfect combination of screenplay and direction the movie has emerged as something miraculously beautiful. Movie sticks to its plot so nicely that there ain't a moment when you go astray. Dialogue are so heart striking you feel every single dialogue since you are embedded in the story as characters itself. There are a few goofs in the movie, but considering the fact that the movie has gone beyond the definitions of a good cinema we can leave those for good.

      "While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film. \n",

However, after I watched it yesterday, it was so impressive.The Shawshank Redemption is a story about Andy Dufresne who is a banker was convicted of murdering his wife so he was caught to the fictional shaw shank stage. Things that happened in shaw shank were terrible but he had a friend named \"Red\" who always supported him. Moreover, he was a genius person so he did everything he could to make things better. In fact, every single thing that he has done, he did it in purpose. And that consequence was over my expectation. What I like most is the story line and the plot was perfect.

      "Talk about your school of hard knocks. In The Shawshank Redemption (Columbia, R), Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a tall, soft-spoken New England banker, is convicted-wrong- ly-of killing his adulterous wife and her lover. It's 1947, and Andy, having received a double life sentence, is shipped off to Shawshank State Prison in Maine, a maximum-security fortress packed to the grimy gills with thieves, rapists, and murderers. How bad is life at Shawshank? So bad that when Andy trudges off the bus along with a dozen other new inmates, the veteran prisoners make wagers on who'll be the first to cry. So bad that Andy finds a huge, wriggly yellow maggot buried in his lunch. So bad that, over the next two years, he is systematically beaten and raped by the Sisters, a crew of leering renegade inmates who take special delight in tormenting their fellow prisoners. Make no mistake: Andy gets worked over-and so does the audience. But then, good things have a way of happening to unfortunate movie characters. Early in his stay, Andy makes the acquaintance of Red (Morgan Freeman), a sly survivor who is serving a life sentence for murder and who acts as Shawshank's one-man black market, smuggling the prisoners anything they want-cigarettes, reefer, cards with naked ladies (''I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck,'' he deadpans). As soon as Andy bonds with Red, things start to ! look up. He gets hold of a rock hammer so that he can sculpt an elegant chess set. He does the guards' tax returns in exchange for perks like beer on a sunbaked afternoon. He expands the dusty, neglected book room into the most comprehensive prison library in New England. Set over a period of 20 years (the passing decades are marked by Andy's pinup posters of Rita Hayworth, then Marilyn, then Raquel), The Shawshank Redemption begins as a nightmare, a postwar- New England Midnight Express, but it doesn't take long to reveal its true, feel-good colors. The movie is about survival, triumph, and a thing called hope. It's about a hero who rises above the squalor because he's blessed-a saint in the muck. It's Midnight Express Goes Gump. You need a certain craftsmanship to traffic in twin brands of manipulation- the exploitative and the sentimental-and there's no denying that Frank Darabont, who wrote and directed The Shawshank Redemption (it's based on a short novel by Stephen King), knows just what he's doing. The moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality; you feel as if you could reach out and touch the prison walls. And Darabont is an accomplished button pusher. He coaches the actors so that you always know exactly who to root for and against. When it comes to a character like the warden (Bob Gunton), all Bible- thumping righteousness, the movie has no compunction about turning up the hissability factor. He starts out mean, then turns meaner, then meaner still. When Andy blasts Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro over loudspeakers to the prison work field, it becomes a full-scale opera-soothes-the-savage-breast number, with the prisoners standing open-mouthed at the sublime sounds. The scene is meant to fire our righteous liberal hearts. It helps, of course, that most of the prisoners don't actually behave like criminals. They never say a word about their pasts-even Andy remains a downtrodden cipher-and this lends the proceedings a hollow, generic feel, as if Darabont had constructed a blueprint out of old prison melodramas. A movie like The Shawshank Redemption, with its brazenly mechanical plotting and its wish-fulfillment finale, requires a lead actor who can carry us on the wings of his good spirits. Tim Robbins is crafty and likable when Andy is hoodwinking the guards, and he makes you feel the character's mute anguish. Yet in shouldering what is essentially a laconic- good-guy, neo-Gary Cooper role, Robbins never quite makes emotional contact with the audience. His face, foggy and placid, suggests an overgrown baby's; there's something naggingly unformed about him. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, with his delicate smolder, his eyes that seem to peer directly into everyone's soul, makes Red feel genuine, lived-in. Speaking of the prison walls, he says, ''First you hate 'em. Then you get used to 'em. After long enough, you get so you depend on 'em. That's institutionalized.'' With his gift for rapt pauses, for caressing just the right syllable, Freeman can make a speech like that sound like one of the philosophical nuggets of the ages. Then again, isn't it time Morgan Freeman stopped playing the soulful sidekick? While we're on the subject of prison walls, an actor as great as he is shouldn't get too used to movies like this one. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about time, patience and loyalty. The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a \"prison drama\" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word \"redemption\" is in the title for a reason. The movie is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. \n",

This English Drama revolves around the character of Andy Dufresne an innocent banker convicted for murdering his wife and her boyfriend, he is sent to the Shawshank Jail to spend his rest of life, and there he finds a friend, Red, who provides him a rock hammer for some indefinite and unknown reason, the speciality of Andy was that he always kept him busy with some work, that he often says, ''Get busy living or get busy dying'', he begin as the financial adviser for the prison guards and continue to be the shape changer of the prison library, but when he realizes that some dark things happening in that penitentiary he try to bring them to light but before he does that he is sent to the solitary confinement, after his release from that confinement he speaks with Red about having the hope and tells about his dreams, that where he want to spend last days of his life and takes the promise from him that if Red get released from the imprisonment he asked him to meet him again, after the day of their conversation Andy find missed from his jail and had escaped through the sewage pipe, but Andy disguise himself in other name and set free from the clutches of cops along with submitting the records about the corruption and the inhuman activities that are seen in Shawshank jail, Red get released after his 40 years of imprisonment and succeeds in keeping his promise to Andy.This movie is neatly crafted by its maker; each character in the play gets its own introduction and style of presenting, the portrayal of the roles like Andy, Red and Brooks are finely shown, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are brilliant in their act, that artistic way of presenting the plot and the dialogues adds extra weightage to the movie, it's the best made movie. \n",

      "This subtitle might sound a little cheesy, but in fact the movie presents us with a story of having to cope with a harsh reality, and in the end, managing to move on from it. The Shawshank Redemption always gives to me the feeling that it is separated between two very different acts. Although this separation isn't balanced in the runtime, it is, in a way, the manner in which the film is constructed.At the beginning, we are introduced to Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a man accused of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison for life, and there he meets Red (Freeman), the man who can get you anything you want. Over the years, Andy will become good friends with Red, be brutally abused by a group of aggressive homosexuals, and participate in a series of scams orchestrated by the warden. All the time Andy spends in incarceration seems like a living hell, thus setting up the dark, absorbing environment of most of the movie's runtime. By the time we get to the last part of the film, we see a pleasant payoff that presents itself in a different tone, one that while sometimes present in the movie's gritty prison setting, lashes out fully in the last few scenes.Directed masterfully by Frank Darabont, and with career defining performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Shawshank lives on as a cinematic landmark. It's a movie that captures the essence of good storytelling and lives up to its legacy through that, while also being a competently made film, with a diverse soundtrack and a beautifully planned production design.For me, The Shawshank Redemption represents assuming responsibility and coming to terms with a complicated situation, while also having the strenght to triumph over adversity. As Andy says, hope is what keeps a man mentally stable and in my estimation the most powerful feeling in a movie like this.Rating 10/10 \n",

      "One of the Best movie I have been seen.If you don't love Shaw shank, chances are you're beyond redemption. This movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goofball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967.Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form.The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle.If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word. \n",

      "It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family.

It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (\"looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over\"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison. \n",

      "One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people \"will\" be talking about in 50 or 100 years. \n",

One of the best movies of the nineties. \"The Shawshank Redemption\" will instantly become a favourite of anyone who watches it. I recommend it to any fan of Stephen King.

They do, however, drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. The leads' combined talents and charisma have a lot to do with this movie's success. I found the acting to be sensational, the dialogue incredible and the director's abilities to be up to par and then some.

It is sentimental and stereotyped, yet we are able not only to suspend our disbelief but to root for it all the way.It's an old-school melodrama at heart, sturdy and forthright and upstanding, but without a whisper of complexity or wit. I have not read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but some of the movie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message and redemption--must have been in the source material.An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all- time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!It may deserve to be generally regarded as (one of) the most overrated film(s) ever made, but it is above all a wonderful, uplifting and deeply touching tale of hope and perseverance that certainly deserves to be remembered as one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story. Before we can critically assess The Shawshank Redemption, we first have to deal with The Shawshank Reputation.

Acting is precise, and reach the soul of the subtext all the way. The director really knew how to pull together an award winning team. Every aspect of the script is taken care of.

Two characters have sex (their clothes are on, and it's not graphic), one lovable character hangs himself, guards shoot an inmate and frame it as an escape attempt, inmates attempt and, we are told, succeed in raping Andy, and guards beat and kill an inmate in the opening scenes.

But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner.

Direction, screenplay,acting everything was brilliant.Tim Robbins was simply outstanding in every aspects. And there was Morgan Freeman. I am a huge fan of him. This duo made this movie excellent, of course along with the director Frank Darabont. The plot evolves around two imprisoned men Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) and Red(Morgan Freeman). The former was imprisoned for murdering his wife and her lover. With the time goes on Andy helps his friends and become a popular figure.But the director kept the best part of the movie at the end. \n",

      "This was an intricately woven tale of an innocent man. He would be our modern day Joseph if you will. What makes it so unusual is that he is a white collar tax accountant that ultimately has to use his knowledge to keep him alive and in a safer position than with the regular population of the prison. The characters and scenes are carefully crafted to horrify and titillate the audience. His wife the victim whom this entire debauched attempt at justice centers, is eliminated, early on as she is caught in an unfortunate love triangle whilst her husband is hard at work providing for her needs. He is then incarcerated for the crime and the action continues to build in one tragic incident to the next until he meets a true friend behind bars. The Sisters are treacherous. The Warden and Captain of the Guard maniacs. The prisoners are utterly lost, uneducated, and misused. There are many victims in this somewhat heroic tale. Had this man never been framed the light of reason would have never illuminated the conditions of prisons. They probably would have been overlooked perhaps another 20 or 30 years. He was the voice of reason that so eloquently told his tale of astonishing misfortune in the first person. \n",

The movie is not only a depressing story but it contains friendship, loyalty, hope and wisdom. Andy (Tim Robbins) is convicted for the murder of his wife and his lover. he is sent to Shawshank prison. He has a life long sentence and in his time in prison Andy becomes friends with Red (Morgan Freeman). Andy tries to adapt to the life in prison and does this together with his friend Red. Through time Andy overcomes the tortures of prison, and he tries to inspire other prisoners (\"While the body may be locked away in a cell, the spirit can never be truly imprisoned). The movie shows the determination of Andy and leads us into a world of imagination, filled with courage and desire. The setting of the movie is extremely realistic and the establishing shot immediately shows the setting of the movie, so you know what to expect. I personally think Shawshank Redemption is the best film ever made. It has already been a number one movie on IMDb for a while now.

Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks.

      "*** This review may contain spoilers ***The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10 \n",

The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live.

I can say it remains to this day the only film that I have watched after reading the story, that is much better and more poignant than the book from which it came. The film itself is told in a great way and filmed brilliantly...not least captured by the character of the warden (depicting what were 3 in the novella). It is full of great supporting characters and turns and there are two brilliant male leads (they both should've have got an Oscar nomination with one of them winning!). It's a film where if I started writing about the components of, or scenes from, I could go on For longer than the film itself...(which despite its length never felt like a long movie!) So will just say that I'd recommend watching it to anyone. I've watched it copious times since first viewing and it never gets boring or do I seem to switch off when it's on...so a boring choice of favourite film, but it really is a great movie.10/10* the collection (4 seasons) of short stories also contains Apt Pupil, which is probably the best of the novella's but was turned into a pretty average movie! \n",

There are not many movies out there that can come close to the quality and excellence of this one from the story to the backgrounds and all the little details . Do your self a service and go and watch it I am sure you wont regret the 3hr length (give or take). g how they were handling their publishing duties. Selected media members were allowed to play the title, the amount of players at once was cut in half near release, and review copies were shipped out just in time for the release of the physical copies of the game. All of this is just speculation on the quality of the title, but after playing Borderlands 2, it makes sense. Even with the Ce-shaded art style being very flattering for weaker hardware, the game still had serious issues that could not be patched up in time for release. The frame rate is almost always below 30fps, and rarely ever stabilizes unless you were to go to a vacant area and just stand there. Sometimes, the game cannot process everything happening on the screen, and the entire game freezes for around 1-2 seconds. The hardware cannot keep up with the action at many points, and this leaves the player frozen, confused, and even sometimes dead. There are numerous cheap deaths in Borderlands 2 due to the lack of hardware power. Although it is clear that the game has many issues resulting from the port job, it is also clear that the developer legitimately tried at this daunting task. Sometimes when it comes to ports, the actual problems stem from the studio that is given the job \n",

      "One of the best movies I have ever seen! A brilliant performance, a life story and the perseverance of achieving your goals! A story about a man imprisoned for killing his wife becomes the true example of the saying that \"not the strongest or the most intelligent survives, survives the one who adapts\". An intelligent person that takes patience and perseverance on this way to freedom. A very calculated plan of escape that takes place over a number of years. A movie that I see every time with that same passion and pleasure. And the voice of Morgan Freeman always makes me feel in the middle of the story with every emotional state that comes with it. \n",

I would recommend it. A guys movie. Girls could enjoy it though. Info below is plot from Wikipedia.The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who spends 19 years in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation. Despite a lukewarm box office reception that barely recouped its budget, the film received multiple award nominations and favorable reviews from critics for its acting and realism. It has since enjoyed a remarkable life on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray. It was included in the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movies 10th Anniversary Edition. \n",

      "This movie is excellent , it is not only an example of utmost focus and effort put by an innocent person to archive his aim. I have gone through The Count of Monte Cristo ; after reading the book of course, that also is inline in some way with the movie; also Escape is one of its kind; The sharpness of mind and the direction or goal through which the hero goes gives sharp example of focus and patience. Shawshank Redemption is The Best movie of all , best part perhaps is the discovery of the tunnel, it is and will be one of my most favored and beloved movies.Only sad part is that I don't see movies like these in air frequently, also could only know the name of the movie through a friend of mine. \n",

      "It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.Several exterior scenes were shot at the Malabar Farm State Park, in nearby Lucas, Ohio. The sequence in which Andy is parked outside his home contemplating murdering his wife was filmed at the Pugh Cabin within the park.The Shawshank Redemption was filmed in and around the city of Mansfield, Ohio, located in north-central Ohio. The prison featured in the film is the old Ohio State Reformatory immediately north of down town Mansfield.The sequences representing the village of Buxton and the field where Red finds Andy's hidden letter were filmed on private land located opposite the park entrance on Bromfield Road. The oak tree is clearly visible from the roadside. The adjacent rock wall, which was constructed specifically for the film, is located on the far side of the hill away from the roadside. The wall is still standing, although it has been somewhat eroded. Other scenes were shot in Ashland, Ohio, Butler, Ohio, Upper Sandusky, Ohio and Portland, Maine.The two scenes in Mexico were filmed on the Island of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The first scene where Andy was driving a convertible on a road along the Pacific Coast with the top down is route 73 on the north side of St. Croix between Salt River (where Christopher Columbus landed in 1493) and Cane Bay.The second scene was the last scene of the movie. Red was walking on a beach toward his friend Andy while he worked on repairs to a boat on the beach. That was filmed at Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge on the south west point of St.Croix. \n",

      "\"The Shawshank Redemption\" isn't a sad story, although you may think it is. There is a lot of feelings in it, like life and humor, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about sustain a sense of personal value, notwithstanding everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.

Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption is so much more then just a \"prison movie\". Indeed a majority of the film takes place in the drab, cold, depressing world of a prison which sets the tone and the stage for the vibrant characters Frank Darabont directs on screen. This is where the movie shines. It's about hope, loyalty, survival and most importantly, friendship. Andy Defresne and Red (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) put on a spectacle in this film, the way they present their characters, the yin and yang of the two is one of the most incredible acting duo's put on celluloid. The film begins with Andy being the one that needs Red, yet in the final act of the film, we see just how much the two need each other. The supporting cast is also brilliant. One of the late, great James Whitmores final great films. I simply cannot do this film justice with words. It's one of those films that needs to be seen at least once. One of the great travesty's is that this film did not win best picture in 1995 or any of the other awards it was nominated for. Not to take away from Forrest Gump, but the Shawshank Redemption simply blew it out of the water. \n",

The acting that was demonstrated was tremendous. I truly enjoyed watching this film. The film Shawshank Redemption conveys to the audience the image of hope in the worst possible situation. Through the themes and the cinematic decisions applied in these two episodes the director has made these vital to the understanding of the movie. He has given two examples of the extreme situations to which prisoners go depending on their emotions. One of the emotions is yet one of the main themes of the movie, hope, and in my opinion it has been brought up extremely effectively. \n",

The lesson of the story is too wide that when you actually do something with zeal and zest then you can achieve it. Morgan Freeman , what a actor he is.Tim Robbins, one of our best, most casual, young actors, plays a banker in the 1940's who is falsely sent to Shawshank Prison for the death of his wife and her lover. In this maximum security penitentiary, Robbins is harassed by the warden, beaten by guards, and sexually abused by inmates. The first and best friend he makes is the elder statesman of the yard, a long time convict played by the great Morgan Freeman. Over time, Robbins will make other friends, some of whom will be absolutely paralyzed by freedom in the straight world.

      "Amir Johnson does a funny thing when you tell him his true value on a basketball court.The Toronto Raptors forward, long the darling of the NBA's stat heads, seems like a modest guy. The night before he gave an interview in Toronto this month, he had appeared as a guest judge on Canada's version of \"Top Chef.\" He might have been fine talking about food instead of basketball; in fact, when a visiting radio host took Johnson aside earlier in the day, the host seemed to care little about the team's first playoff appearance since 2008. Instead, for an on-air bit, he cajoled Johnson into singing the Backstreet Boys instead of his teammates' praises.But now the topic at hand is this: Johnson is worth a ton to the Raptors, who tied their first-round playoff series with the Nets at two games apiece Sunday night in Brooklyn. At just 26 years old, he's never made an All-Star team -- hasn't even come close. Not once in his nine seasons has he averaged more than 11 points or 7.5 rebounds per game. Sometimes, he doesn't even start. Yet there is a large sect of league followers that consider Johnson among the most valuable, efficient and irreplaceable players in the NBA.When he is told this, Johnson pulls a hand toward his face and cups it with his palm. He shields himself from view for an instant, turning his head down, away from a reporter, and to the floor. But there is a smile there, too. \n",

This is one of those movies that will put you to think, that how patience can yield you fruits and how impatience and wrath can put you to jail. His anger made him do something (though he didn't do it) but he did act towards killing his wife, which lead him to jail.

For me, his condescending delivery which peels back of the top layer of the man onion, defines this film, and so it starts to lose me a bit. This is a really good story but so much of the film is made up of episodes of over the top male bonding. I find it astonishing that it rates so highly to be honest. I also have a problem with the plethora of goofs. Why do the contents of an atmospheric sewerage line explode upon the breaking of its pipe with a brick? Like that would work anyway. And why place a boat that you want to paint paint right on the edge of the sea as the moment the tide comes in it will simply float away? And how did our protagonist get the poster stuck back once he went through his escape tunnel in the wall? There are so many stupid parts to it.

      "Talk about not getting it. The clue to just how badly the reviewer missed lies in the title. The theme is REDEMPTION, not hope or sentimental treacle or the evils of capital punishment and Rush Limbaugh. Further, it's a FANTASY, as close to Neal Gaiman as Stephen King has ever come. (Hint: Fantasies aren't supposed to be real.) Nor is Andy Dufresne a Cooperesque character. Rather, he is written as diffident, difficult, and entirely unlovable at first blush. See my next. All these comments are funny. I'm glad Glieberman wrote this review. Everything he says about this overrated piece of goop is true. It IS sentimental and exploitative, and makes prison seem trivial; who cares about the rape if eventually I'll be redeemed, Hollywood style? The characters are thinly portrayed, and it has little connection with grit or honesty. Along with Forrest Gump and Gone With The Wind, one of the most overpraised movies ever made. \n",

Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the \"bull queer\" gang \"the Sisters\" and their leader, Bogs (Mark Rolston).In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library.In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea.

He has Andy launder the money using the alias \"Randall Stephens\".In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package. Red becomes concerned with Andy's state of mind, particularly when he learns Andy asked another inmate to supply him with six feet of rope.The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.After serving 40 years, Red receives parole.

Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. \"When they put you in that cell,\" Red says, \"when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.\" Watching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I saw it.

      "'The Shawshank Redemption' is a brilliant adaptation, if only because Darabont has some quintessential scenes added. So Andy locks himself inside the library, while he plays opera music all over the courtyard. In another sequence Darabont shows the suicide of an old freed prisoner who cant get used to the outside world. There are some smaller changes to the characters. Both in the book and the film Tommy Williams is the young rascal who tells Andy who really killed his wife. Andy gets excited and gets a month of solitary confinement, but in the move Williams is murdered.The film is quite a gem. He tastes like freedom on a silver blue bird. Freedom on a hot summer day. Freedom as \"wander around the prison grounds like you can go to a cocktail party at anytime \" Freedom after forty years' imprisonment. 'The Shawshank Redemption' colors the most morbid mind blue. The color of the sea, The color of Andy's freedom. \n",

The part where Red is describing how Andy got out just fills my heart and to see Andy's smile at the end bring it full circle!

      "It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (\"looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over\"), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison. People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well. Films about \"redemption\" are approached with great wariness; a lot of people are not thrilled by the prospect of a great film - it sounds like work. But there's a hunger for messages of hope, and when a film offers one, it's likely to have staying power even if it doesn't grab an immediate audience.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 1994, and opened a few weeks later.

Frank Darabont masterfully entwines fate, courage, fear, hardship, friendship, dreams and above all HOPE into one truly enticing cinematic experience.

Besides the warden and Freeman and Robbins, the performances were adequate but forgettable. The reason I gave it a six is because it's not really challenging. It is conventional as far as style and content. This is not a bad thing because it does use convention effectively. Clearly the movie has touched a lot of people. It is more effective than the source material in terms of getting it's point across. The Stephen King short story did not have as much impact and the embellishments that Frank Darabont added (like the sewer scene) definitely added to the emotional content of the story. \n",

      "All Time Great Movie - rom Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. \"I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,\" he tells Red. \"Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'.\"The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well.

When I first saw this film, I was blown away.With superb acting, superb story, perfect emotion and tone, and an incredible twist ending that still amazes me, this film is completely and utterly perfect. The film speaks of hope, and the film's two main characters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes that, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used because it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes that hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better tomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight.While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be held to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of the greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is merely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly great, but not the masterpiece that it is today. And, watching it repeatedly makes the film even better, because experiencing the events that occur within the story makes the ending even greater.I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over and over again, and love it more each time I watch it.

      "I like that part when it turns out to be an action movie. And now, some Lorem Ipsum to make the review longer:But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business is will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains. \n",

But there was another film I saw multiple times in the theater in '94 - The Shawshank Redemption.And this one, hardly anyone saw in the theater. Nobody really knew about it, until all of a sudden it was nominated for Best Picture and lots more Oscars. But honestly no one in the world thought it would win, I'm sure the Vegas odds were laughable. And of course Forrest Gump overshadowed both Shawshank & Pulp Fiction. So Shawshank was my film for years, I found it - randomly at my local theater. I owned it on VHS, I watched it incessantly. It's been my favorite film for 20 years. It's well known it gained a cult following on VHS. But IMDb really put it on the map. And IMDb is to be thanked for the last 7 or 8 years, of idiots who've just come into the film recently claiming it's \"a trendy film to claim as your favorite.\" I want to get physically violent with people who say that. Rather, it's trendy for idiots to say it's trendy to love Shawshank.It doesn't matter. Shawshank is timeless. It is so layered, so thick & dense with ideas & emotions, subtleties & nuance & little moments that are gigantic. Watching Shawshank is a spiritual experience, a journey that never gets old. It's a drug.God, I just saw IMDb is getting close to racking up 1,200,000 votes on Shawshank. And 9.3. You cannot argue with that. It cuts across cultures, sexes, and races.

The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come. \n",

      "Shawshank is unique in the genre and unlocked a new potential for movie makers to break the inherent confines of a prison picture. This was demonstrated later on with Darabont once again redefining the prison picture in The Green Mile - a classic in its own right. So why is Shawshank so popular and tops many best movie lists? Not hard to figure out. The entertainment value is high and our empathy is heightened for Andy and Red. A lot of deserved attention over the years has gone to Freeman, but Robbins carries his part just as well. We have to remember the Andy character is somewhat that of a semi-tough geek, which is a tough balancing act to portray - unless part of your own personality is much like that. Robbins impresses me for this and meets the expectation. But I think Freeman's character allows more scope for exceeding an expectation which is probably why Freeman is lauded a bit more. So Shawshank, after all these years, still awaits like a trap to ensnare new devotees. Another sign of its worthiness - it pulls you in quickly. \n",

      "It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but \"The Shawshank Redemption\" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. \"Shawshank\" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Darabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up or upstage it. Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. \"When they put you in that cell,\" Red says, \"when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.\" Watching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I saw it. Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it does with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is our redeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits. \n",

      "In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. \n",

      "It's been 15 years since I watched this movie for the first time. Back then, in my youth, several aspects of this movie made me think a lot: the value of true friendship, the injustices in life, the importance of not giving up on your dreams and, the most powerful of all, always have hope and make your thoughts and actions rely on that hope. I also remember thinking that, while some characters got what they deserved, others were wronged in a way that annoyed me too much. That was the reason that I liked but not loved this movie in the first time.After that first time, I watched this movie at least another five times. Today, 15 years later, I can say that the injustices in the movie are not only bearable but also completely necessary. This is the real magic about this movie: you can find good in murderers, evil in wardens, friendship in a deceitful place, justice in injustices and hope in despair. Those ingredients are responsible for making this story so believable. This movie is capable of captivating the viewer through the natural bond created with the protagonist, in such way that, in the end, when everything went to despair, the viewer learns that hope is the only thing that anyone should not abandon. Yes, this movie is a true masterpiece. \n",

The mood can get to be a little deep, so if you have any un-mended wounds deep within your soul, make sure to have an endless supply of tissues at hand. It is a film about beating the odds, about injustice and retribution. It isn't really a movie about payback as much as it is about looking inside oneself, seeing the good in life and the digging in of their heels when circumstances become seemingly overwhelming and impossible. The story almost follows the classic structure of the hero's journey and manages to hit every emotional nerve on the way. There is one other movie that I can think of in all of cinema history that has managed to pull that off and it is the princess bride. The princess bride is very light hearted and is nothing like The Shawshank Redemption except for the fact that it is multi faceted and emotional. \n",

This three points makes it easier for the director to say the movie's result: hope. The other movies such as The Gosfather don't have such points; that makes them always \"the second movie\".

      "This movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goofball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967.Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form.The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle.If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word. \n",

      "\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty - - not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest bus load of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a \"prison drama\" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word \"redemption\" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. \n",

But still till present, Shawshank has not lost any of its aura. it is a beautiful experience watching this movie. many would review this movie as over-hyped, overrated and all. i think they are just trying to describe cinematic experience, but this movie is a Life experience. So that is a point where they differ. The one who says Shawshank is overrated, might not say the same about The Green Mile(same director and author). I have always admired the works of Stephen king, but his works just seemed too much for movies. Even Stanley Kubrick couldn't quite actually cover The Shining. We had to wait until Frank Darabont to get a good portrayal of king's work. and the wait was finally worth it. The green mile is the next, though it isn't as much high on the rating as this one.

You feel so moved all along the movie and when the movie is over I have this impression that it was a movie quiet \"simple\" shared with a feeling of having saw something that is a way higher others movies. And that is what make this movie extraordinary. \n",

      "One of the best movies ever. This one never gets old. Tim Robbins is my favorite actor and was before this movie. This movie is one of his best. His other classic favorite of mine is Jacobs Ladder. Love the development of the characters in the movie. Each one is his on and adds to the movie. Very good script, very original, clever. I wish he would have won the Oscar for this movie. I also wish Morgan Freeman would have won as well. Another point that was made in this movie that sticks, is how when you have done the same thing for so long, you don't know how to not do it. Point was made and shown several times by different actors. Love this quote: She was beautiful. God I loved her. I just didn't know how to show it. \n",

      "The Shawshank Redemption(1994) is an American drama movie set in 1947 and spanning 20 years of two prisoners at Shawshank who survive the place with no hope of ever coming out, but one still thrives on the 'dangerous' but 'good thing'. Based on a novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King, the movie hooks you from its very first scene. An innocent person, Andy Dufresne is convicted for two life sentences, and in the prison, he meets Red, a man who have spent almost twenty years there, and one, who has been here as long as he can remember (50 years). With a life different from anything in the outside world, the movie takes you on a tour of life of these people where corruption, hypocrisy of religion and authority, friendship and enmity are hard to miss.Morgan Freeman as Red with a very natural acting, and Tim Robins as Andy Dufresne playing a young, bright and observant banker, the movie, written and directed by Frank Darabont has soothing background music and great cinematography.A must, must watch. \n",

      "In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis Red Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont.~ Mark Deming, \n",

I like to read, but one of the things I love the most is to watch movies, I saw this one when I was 15 and it opened my mind to a movie world that I never imagined, puts your mind into how life can be unfair and how to look a way out and take advantage with what you have in hand, and think that when you put your mind into something wonderful things can happen. I am sure I'm not the only one that has been touched by this film, and I don't know what to say anymore than this is one of the most wonderful movies ever made, with this one I became a Morgan Freeman and Frank Darabont's fan.

      "\"The Shawshank Redemption\" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest bus load of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside. \n",

      "Like some other reviewers, I had avoided watching this: jail movies, Stephen King ( and don't get me wrong - I really like his novels and the films esp The Shining - even though he hated Kubrick's version - but I had an expectation of his work which was counter to what makes a 'universal' movie).Eventually, by accident, I had it on in the background on a UK digital channel, but in about 10 minutes in I stopped doing what I was doing and watched it. There's no point in my trying to add much to the thousands of words that have been written about this - all I know is that it touched me deeply - and in a way that I thought an all male cast and plot setting couldn't do. A truly beautiful, thought provoking and 'moral tale'.If there is anyone one out there who still haven't seen this - I really suggest that you do so. I simply can't believe that it barely recovered budget in the 90's when it was first released.I think it is one of the most exceptionally brilliant movies Hollywood has ever produced.Morgan Freeman was brilliant, of course, but it is an ensemble piece: the whole is much much greater than its parts. \n",

      "When I read the book, actually novella, I had no idea it was being made into a movie. I was delighted that I was actually seeing a film after I had read the book - this never happens. My first surprise was how they pronounced Andy Dufresne's last name - in the book I did not pronounce it do-Frayne. I also wasn't expecting Red to be a black man but a white Irish guy.This is a superb film that takes the \"prison film\" genre on and wins. Tim Robbins is perfectly cast and Morgan Freeman is highly watchable. His voice-over really adds gravitas and a link to the audience wondering how Andy will ever survive the awful existence of prison life.The prison itself is so imposing and the prisoners, for the most part, scary. Although not too many people were in the cinema when I saw it, I knew it would be a film that people would come to love.

      "In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were \"just happy to be nominated.\" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word \"go,\" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on \"that 'Rickshaw' movie.\" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, \"it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale.\" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; \"In here's where you need it most,\" he says. \"You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch.\" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking \"that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass\" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, \"It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying.\" \n",

Now, being someone who isn't easily pleased; I went into The Shawshank Redemption with reservations. Coming out of the film, I realized that it made me feel warm. I know that's a weird saying but it's a comfort film. A lot of people love it because it leaves you feeling happy and hopeful; not disturbed like Chinatown or frightened like Halloween (1978). Shawshank is sentimental, joyful and has one great ending. Yet, the film feels so \"safe\"; leading the audience to a bittersweet and somewhat forced conclusion. Overall, The Shawshank Redemption is a good film; it just doesn't take risks. Shawshank feels just fine in its little comfortable cinematic world. If people enjoy that type of film, that's fine; I just think a film that takes more risks (2001: A Space Odyssey or The Tree Of Life) should be deserving of the top spot of the IMDb Top 250. \n",

Yes, friendship is the key theme of the movie that propels the plot till the very last shot of the film since the beginning of the narration but apart from the main theme of film being hope and friendship, this film strongly con-notates the power of patience and persistence. Would not like to talk about the entire story here but next time you watch this, just take a close look at Andy, and the way he holds his emotion at the beginning in the court and till the very end when he wears the polished shoe of Warden, no doubt there is deep sorrow and regret but above all, a sign of hope and his patience to make things happen is always there throughout the movie-be it winning to get the books, more books or even beer for his friends despite he doesn't drink himself.

They don't have to like it ( which I find out pretty rare ) but they have to admit, they acting was great. Writing this review makes me want to watch it again. The ending always makes me smile. \n",

      "I'm a guy that takes pride on the fact of being quite open-minded when it comes to appreciating different genres and kinds of stories. I love movies that faithfully and movingly depict the ugly side of humanity, but every now and then I also like something that tells us that not everything is lost.The Shawshank Redemption introduces us to Andy Dufresne. A gentile yet emotionally estranged banker who's wrongfully accused of murdering his wife and her lover. This brings him to a gruesome prison were his will to maintain his humanity will be put to the test by the corrupt and abusive authorities of the prison, and also by some of his fellow inmates. In this bleak scenario he will find hope in the guise of friendship. Which will push him to rise above the situation.This movie is all about hope. About the power of friendship and the reluctance to give up on life, even under the darkest circumstances. Even locked in a pit of pure evil, human spirit can be enough to lift you up.Tim Robbins is convincing and moving in his performance, although he is outshone by a brilliant Morgan Freeman, who always seems to effortlessly touch the soul of the audience with his performances. The bad guys also generate the right amount of repulsion, with a good job from Bob Gunton as the morally questionable warden and Clancy Brown in the memorable role of the violent and vicious captain Hadley.I've seen some reviews questioning the placement of this film as #1 for IMDb users. I don't think any of us can put a movie above all the rest or below them. Art is subject to personal appreciation and there will never be a single opinion more valuable than the rest. What's undeniable is that Shawshank caused what it intended. Moving the majority of people that have seen it through a beautiful story that aims to the human spirit and it's power to shed light in the darkest moments. \n",

Should be shown to young adults to teach them the value of patience, which is something that's going out of fashion in this era of 'everything online'.There's something to be said about Stephen King. . . he may not be the best writer, but he is definitely the best storyteller. \n",

This movie will make you feel for each character. you will happy and sad all at the same time. If you have not seen this movie yet, you must. It is my #1 movie. I can't say it is best for kids, due to some scenes. This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget. \n",

      "In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis \"Red\" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red.

Morgan Freeman and all the other actors played absolutely amazing. The music in this movie is just unbelievable, it's just incredible how well the people behind this movie managed to make the music highlight the mood. If you take the time to notice the music, you'll understand why it made such a difference for me. And when it comes to the story I have absolutely no words.

I didn't understand all of the stuff, and why it happened, but I still thought it was the greatest movie of all time. When I saw it again, a few years later, it was even better. This is one of the types of movies that you can see a ton of times and keeps getting better.

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who spends 19 years in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation.Despite a lukewarm box office reception that barely recouped its budget, the film received multiple award nominations and favorable reviews from critics for its acting and realism. It has since enjoyed a remarkable life on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray. It was included in the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movies 10th Anniversary Edition. [2] \n",

Shawshank has the amazing ability that most films lack to grab our attentions and keep it for such a long length of time. It also has the ability to make out spirits soar unlike any other film.

It encompasses many moral values that most people don't think twice about. It's got crazy and heart sulking relationships, and you will have no other choice but to empathize with the main character.

      "The Shawshank Redemption isn't your average movie with big explosions, gun fights, or super heroes instead its just a simple movie about a friendship that forms between two prisoners each serving a life sentence for murder. My favorite thing about the movie is all of the remember able quotes that you can take from it. Mine is a conversation between the district attorney and Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) the conversation goes like this District Attorney: \"And that also is very convenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne\"? Andy: \"Since I am innocent of this crime, sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.\" Out of all of the amazing quotes from this movie this is my favorite because it says early in the film the this character can be funny even at his own murder trial and he can be a little sarcastic to. Another reason I really enjoyed the film was watching how the writers of the movie developed the relationship of Red (Morgan Freeman) and Andy overtime. The first time Red saw Andy he says \"I didn't think much of Andy the first time I saw him\", but they would develop a very strong friendship as the movie goes on. Every character in this movie is different from any other character in someway. Red is seems to be wise, nice, and doesn't ever stress out ever. Andy is clever, smart, and what seems to be a good person. Warden Norton seems to be evil, manipulative, and controlling. Something that is a bit ironic from this movie is that most the prisoners seem to nice guys while Norton and the guards seem to be the real criminals I thought it was inserting that makers of the movie decided to kind of change the ways we are used to seeing things. The thing the movie shows the best is that with time everything can change for example Andy was once just a banker until he he went to prison and meet Red which probably was the most meaningful thing he ever did in his life. Although the story may look like your same old prison movie its not it has many unexpected twist through out the whole movie. Most films you watch today just focus on action and big name actors but, this isn't one of those movies it gives real attention to the story being to told and even two friends talking in the prison yard will have you on the edge of your seat and wondering what is going to happen next. This is one of those movie you watch 5 times and still enjoyed it and catch something new you hadn't noticed before. This movie will be talked about for many many more years ahead and will never get old. The Shawshank Redemption was nominated more 7 Oscars and in my opinion has the best acting of any film I have ever seen. So if you feel like taking a break from your normal blockbuster movie and sees and movie that tells a great story of hope and friendship then I would highly recommend watching this movie. \n",

Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. \"When they put you in that cell,\" Red says, \"when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.\" Watching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I saw it.

      "The Shawshank Redemption is a good movie. It has a good story and good acting. Though I don 't think that the movie is good enough to be at the top of the 250 list at IMDb. I think that it is a great \"prison movie\" but it's so similar to other books and movies like Midnight Express or The Escape From Alcatraz. A \"prison movie\" that is much better but doesn't get the glory and credibility is The Green Mile witch made me more emotional and excited. Compared with The Shawshank Redemption, The Green mile has a better storyline and most important an original prison story.The Shawshank Redemption is about man called Andy who is being wrongly accused for a crime that he didn't do. He was given two life sentences for killing his wife and her lover in cold blood. Therefore he is being sent to Shawshank Prison. Andy learns to adapt to prison life and he meets knew friends, but also enemies. The life in prison is hard and he meets a lot of obstacles as the story goes.As I said earlier, it is a good movie and you should see it if you haven't. However in my opinion it is too unoriginal and safe for the best film in history as many other think. By saying safe I mean that the director could have done something that had made me remember the film. Something out of the ordinary. Instead of the \"escape prison\" unoriginality. Cause now I think it's just a bland movie.Another thing that I think the movie misses is more fighting and crime. Isn't this a prison? Should it not have any sort of violent behavior? Sure Andy fights of a bunch of enemies in a few short scenes, but I don't think that that's enough. The thing is that Andy's enemies are the only bad guys in the whole movie. At least of what we see in this film. The film could have exploited more violence and crime, but instead we get a nice old man that feeds his bird. Andy's friends are so nice that I sometimes feel like they are workmates instead of committed criminals. When they are out in the yard all convicts are just playing ball and talking like they are having a lunch brake. I don't mean that all prisoners should just fight and swear but it could have least been one fight seen in the yard so you get a bit more of that prison feeling.In conclusion it's a good movie with some flaws. It's has many good scenes. Though in my opinion it fails because of its blandness and unoriginality. They should have put more effort in making something more memorable.Based on my judgment it's a 8/10 and I think that it's a fare rating. It should have its title in the top 250, but not the number one.//Swedish Critic \n",

I saw it when it was new and now, years later, it still has the same power. It is a timeless masterpiece.The writing, the acting, the emotion are all superb. The story and characters draw you in and keep you captivated form the beginning of the movie right up until the end.I will not discuss the contents of the story as I do not want to post accidental spoilers. I can honestly say, if you haven't seen this movie already you need to go out and watch it right now. \n",

      "Shawshank Redemption is quite possibly the best movie ever made. This includes all time frames and genres. There are no flaws in this story; only brilliance. It's simply a remarkable story. It's a timepiece feature with an amazing cast. Character development is top-notch. The story line and delivery are extraordinary. I wish I could re- watch this movie over again as if I had never seen it before, so do yourself a favor... if you're watching this movie or plan to watch this movie for the first time... turn off your phone, dim the lights and be prepared to be amazed. It's an enriching story with adult content that is suitable for older kids. You will laugh. You will cry. You will get angry. And... you will feel love, hope and redemption unlike any movie you have ever seen before. Shawshank Redemption is unforgettable. \n",

I had never seen this movie until about 3 or 4 months ago and I had also heard so much about it, having watched it I've listened and heard it everywhere only good things and people saying it is the best movie ever and I 100% agree it is the best movie ever. There are some brilliant and creative movies out there but this movie really appeals to all our senses and is magnificent. I don't know how the writers even came up with such a good storyline. Also well done to the actors who played such a good part in the movie and made it come to life on the big screen. One of my fave actors was in it which made it for me and that was Morgan Freeman! I love his voice and I truly admire his acting skills. As a director and cameraman I admire the fantastic work of the cameramen and the brilliant directing. Well done to everyone involved in this movie, I imagine they are very proud of what they have created and indeed they should be! \n",

      "This is my favorite movie of all time and there is a good reason for it. When i was still in my early teens i would only watch action movies and would disregard any drama movie, i could not understand why anyone would want to watch a movie like this. one day there were no action movies on TV and me being bored i was skipping franticly through the TV guide, i could not find anything worth my time, i thought. And then i got to a movie that got rated 5 stars! I could not believe this, i had never seen a movie in the TV guide get rated 5 stars not even the action movies i enjoyed so much which surprised me at the time. So me scratching my face with boredom i decided to watch this movie because after all there has to be something to this movie it being rated 5 stars and all. as the movie was going along it was so calming and smooth that today this day i cannot find the right words to describe it- it felt like it was never going to end but, i didn't wanted it to end it! it was incredible, this movie expanded my motion-picture viewing to whole new levels. Therefore it will always be my favorite movie.P.S Sorry for my English-writing, I'm dutch. \n",

It was boring and a usual prison based movie at the very beginning. It keeps you watching as you watching. I would recommend to keep watching the whole movie in order to understand fully.I would in fact recommend you to watch for several times. As you watch again you see different things.It has a great storyline. The pace of the film changes. Cast are nicely chosen. And actors act very well. It has an adventurous story. Although most of the film is about prison life, it surprises the audience by freedom at the end.Costumes were chosen nicely as well. I felt time travelling through watching the film. I do not know if I needed to comment on this too. However, when ever I watch a film I watch in detail.Performance, costume, location, reality, story, picture and sound quality are very important for me. I can tell you I have seen good quality in most of the above mentioned aspects. \n",

      "Frank Darabont directed this superb adaptation of the Stephen King novella that stars Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a young banker who was wrongfully convicted for the murders of his wife and her boyfriend. Upon arrival at Shawshank prison in Maine, he keeps to himself mostly, causing no trouble, though does befriend long-time inmate \"Red' Redding(played by Morgan Freeman) who teaches him the ropes of prison life, though the unwanted attentions of degenerate inmates pushes poor Andy to the edge of despair, until his financial skills as a banker prove most useful to both the corrupt Captain of the guards(played by Clancy Brown) and corrupt warden(played by Bob Gunton) until Andy hits upon a most clever escape plan... Now legendary film that sits atop the IMDb best film list is indeed a worthy film(though not my pick!) Still, done with remarkable skill on every filmmaking level. Could be viewed as an allegory of Christianity, but is indeed an uplifting story of friendship and the human spirit. Supporting characters(except for the one played by James Whitmore) aren't that appealing, but aren't intended to be either! Perfect ending as well. \n",

The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.

The storyline was really well-crafted, and putting in these unforgettable characters made it even better. From Red to Andy to Norton, they we're all just wonderful and enjoyable characters, especially Red and Andy. The relationship between those two is what really holds the balance of the movie.

And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film.

A lot happens, yet the film just seems to amble confidently along like the film's main character. This film works on so many levels and definitely rewards repeated viewing. The cinematography and music are wonderful, as are the central performances. Yet for all this it is the tale itself and how it is told that makes this (one of) the greatest stories ever told. People have theorized about what this film means ...is it an disguised story of Jesus?...a simple tale of friendship?...a tale of corruption?...a lecture on faith and 'holding on'?...or is the main character not who we think it to be for 3/4 of the film? After all there is one major 'redemption' in this film: a man who has to decide whether \"It's time to get busy dying, or get busy living\". REDEEM YOURSELF, SEE THIS FILM. \n",

Story of Stephen King, screenplay, dialogs, drama, suspense, crime and action. I compare Morgan to Amitabh Bachchan of Hollywood. The brief voice of Freeman moves me whenever I heard him.

The scene on the beach was out of character with the rest of the film, even though Andy had talked about it earlier. And HE IS WORKING ON SOME PIECE OF SH*T BOAT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE?! HOW did it get there? I thought, \"WHY such an ending to what up to now had been a great film?

And when he came to the Shawshank he gives all the others the impression he is the first victim of the other prisoners but he always take his head up, and because of his experience he uses his knowledge to make his and the life of the friends he meet in the prison a little better. In the end you can see that the actor Tim Robbins mystify all the people who thought they know him, so he can break out and give the Shawshank chief and the employees the lesson which they don't forget for their life.

      "Best movie ever! Story line ...awesome! A man convicted of murder lives in a prison brutally ruled by a sadistic warden and secretly run by a con who knows all the ropes and pulls all the strings. The story is narrated by man named Red, who killed his wife to collect insurance. Everyone is probably thinking \"what an awful man\" and \"I already don't like this guy\" but throughout the story without knowing, you start to actually feel sorry for him and everyone else in the prison. I don't know what it is that Stephen King does but you really start to feel like they all have done nothing wrong. When a man by the name of Andy Dufrense comes to Shawshank on charges of killing his wife Linda Dufrense and her lover Glenn Quentin, who was a golf pro he changes the prison and he becomes a man nobody will ever forget. Andy claims to be not guilty, and throughout the story he tries to prove that. He usually keeps to himself and he has this attitude about him that doesn't seem right for a prisoner at Shawshank prison. He walks around calmly and upright just as if he was talking a walk through the park, this doesn't land Andy many friends. While doing his time in Shawshank he is constantly fighting a battle with these men people call the sisters and his freedom. This book is a very adventurous and somewhat mysterious book, it's probably not suitable for younger readers just because of the language and some sexual content, but I would definitely recommend it to young adults. \n",
